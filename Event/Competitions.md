The next races were held at Martin on March 2, 1930, for the Slallom trophy, donated by [Robert Hayes](/Person/Robert-Hayes), and for the down hill trophy, the gift of [W. J. Maxwell](/Person/Bill-Maxwell). The purpose of the Slallom race is to develop proficiency in turns and the course was laid on the west slope of [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill). It was won by Wolf Bauer. Hans-Otto Giese was second, and Hans Grage third. The winner's time was one minute six and four fifths seconds. The weather conditions were not entirely satisfactory, due to a crusty surface.

The purpose of the down hill race is to promote skill and speed in down hill running. It started in the timber of [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill) and finished just above the Hut. This was won by Hans Grage, Hans-Otto Giese placing second and Wolf Bauer third.

The races for the University Book Store trophies were also held at Martin on March 9. The women's race was over a course starting from the Hut, going east, roughly paralleling the Northern Pacific Railroad. It then turned at right angles in a southerly direction, finally working back to the Hut along the contours of [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill). It was about two and one-half miles in length. Mary Dunning was winner of first place, Mrs. Stuart P. Walsh, second, and Vava Squires, third. The weather was fair with some fresh snow.

The men's race started from the top of [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill), crossing over to the power line hill, thence in a large loop over toward Stampede Pass, returning around the lower northeast side of the power line hill, over to Meany Hill, finishing at the Hut. The course was about seven miles in length. Hans-Otto Giese and Hans Grage tied for first place, their time being fifty-two minutes. Paul Shorrock was third.

The Patrol race was held March 23, 1939, for a cup donated by A. W. Anderson and N. W. Grigg. The course was from the Lodge to Martin and followed the regular Forest Service trail to Olalee Meadows, Mirror Lake, Yakima Pass, Meadow Creek, Dandy Creek, Dandy Pass, finishing at Martin. For details regarding equipment, start, rules to be observed, etc., the reader is referred to the Mountaineer Annual of 1929, pages 46 and 47.

The weather was very unfavorable on the day of the race, due to several days' fall of fresh snow, which made the going extremely heavy, despite the valiant efforts of the trail breaking crew. There were four patrols of three persons each entered as follows: (1) Hans-Otto Giese, Andrew W. Anderson and [Fred Ball](/Person/Fred-Ball); (2) Paul Shorrock, N. W. Grigg and [Robert Hayes](/Person/Robert-Hayes); (3) Allan Cox, George Tepley and Robert Sperlin; and (4) Ted Lewis, William A. Degenhardt and James C. Martin. The start was made from Snoqualmie Lodge at 8:17 a.m., March 23.

The patrol consisting of Hans-Otto Giese, A. W. Anderson and Fred Ball won first place, finishing at 3:47:50 p.m., after covering the twenty

mile course in seven hours, thirty minutes and fifty seconds. Paul Shorrock, N. W. Grigg and Robert Hayes took second place.
The first and only ski jumping contest of the season was held on the rock slide at Snoqualmie Lodge, March 30. The trophy was donated by the Outdoor Store of Seattle. The contest was judged on form and distance, a maximum of twenty points being allowed on each.

Hans-Otto Giese won first place with a score of 18.38. Otto Strizek took second with 13 points and Hans Grage third with 10 points. The contest was judged by Peter Hortmark of the Seattle Ski Club.

The ski-jumping contest was the last event of the year and marked the completion of a competitive ski season such as The Mountaineers as an organization had never before witnessed. Certain it is that the interest aroused by these events will do much to place skiing in its rightful place as the king of all our activities.

At Meany Ski Hut, on January 12, the cross country cups, in their eighth year of competition, were won by Doris Edson and Wolf Bauer. Three weeks later, at the same place, two slalom trophies and a downhill trophy were up for the seventh time. Wolf Bauer was crowned a triple champion by taking both the men's slalom and downhill in addition to his earlier success in the cross country. Jane Stahmer won the women's slalom. The Ski Patrol Race, also started seven years earlier, and for club members only, was run February 16 from the Lodge to Meany over a perfect trail and in powder snow. Wolf Bauer, Chet Higman and Bill Miller made the

eighteen-mile crossing in 4 hours, 27 minutes and 23 seconds, nearly an hour faster than the old record. The most ancient Mountaineer ski trophy, the women's cross country cup competed for at the Lodge for the past fifteen years, was won by Adelaide Copp. The Harper trophy, only a year younger and for the winner of a cross country race for novices, was not awarded last season because of avalanche conditions on the first scheduled date and lack of entries on the second. The jumping trophy, another seven-year-old cup, went to Scott Osborn for placing third, higher than any other club member, in the Class C Pacific Northwest jumping championship at Beaver Lake, March 22.
