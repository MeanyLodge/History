Held in 2003

#### Meany's Tom-Cat

(to the tune of "Oh My Darling Clementine"). Words by Charlotte Green

````
In the mountains, on the hillsides
    Where the snow is deep and fine
Their you'll find Tom Van DeVanter
    Towing skiers in a line.

REFRAIN: Here's to Com-Cat, Meany's Tom-Cat
Braving blizzards, slush and rain
Bringing Mountaineers to Meany
And back to their cars again

From the highway to the ski lodge
    80 skiers brave and bold
Tomcat tows them up the mountain
    Through the mornings snowy cold.

Repeat REFRAIN

#### Cheer the Start of Meany's Season

to the tune of "Deck the Halls". Words by Charlotte Green

````
Cheer the start of Meany's season
    We want lots of snow-ow, we want snow
We want snow, not rain that's freezin
    We want lots of snow-ow, we want snow
We want snow that's thickly falling
    We want snow, we want snow, we want snow
We can hear the ski slopes calling
    We want lots of snow-ow, we want snow

Meet the famous Meany tow rope
    We want lots of snow-ow, we want snow
Flipping skiers off the snow slope
    We want lots of snow-ow, we want snow
Roaring ripe bites smoking ski glove
    We want snow, we want snow, we want snow
Reaching speeds we can't conceive of
    We want lots of snow-ow, we want snow

We can't ski on mud and gravel
    We want lots of snow-ow, we want snow
We need snow to really travel
    We want lots of snow-ow, we want snow
Down the Lane with edges blazing
    We want snow, we want snow, we want snow
Meany's skiing's quite amazing
    We want lots of snow-ow, we want snow

#### Meany Ski Lodge

- to the tune of "Oh Suzanna". Words by Charlotte Green
- written for Ray Nelson's retirement celebration 3/2/1990

````
1. In '28, near Stampede Pass,
    A group of Mountaineers
Began to build the Meany Lodge --
    A paradise for skiers

Chorus:
    Meany skiers,
        We ski the unpacked snow.
    The rope tow whisks us to the ridge
        And down the Lane we go!

2. Each season at the Meany Lodge
    Brings its own crisis new.
And every time, with grit and pluck
    The Meanyites come through.

3. When Ray came on as Meany's "boss"
    Way back in sixty-six,
He set the mood for Meany Lodge,
    "Ain't nothin' we can't fix!"

4. Ray's been our boss for 20 years,
    Ain't nothing we can't do.
We've built the worm- and turtle tows,
    Rebuilt the kitchen, too.

Chorus: Dug more basement,
    Put in a concrete floor,
Built a new Fourth People's Dorm,
    A fire alarm and more.

5. But our best times at Meany Lodge
    Come when the work is done.
When Meany skiers hit those hills
    Aint no one has more fun!

Chorus: Meany skiers,
    We love to ski the Lane,
then North and South Slobbovia,
    Then down the Lane again!

Dedication Chorus:
Thanks Ray Nelson
    Your work as "boss" is done;
But your good work at Meany Lodge
    Gives everyone more fun!
````

#### Wild Bill Maxwell

to the tune of "Casey Jones"

````
Come on you skiers if you want to hear
The story of a brave mountaineer
Wild Bill Maxwell was the skiers name
At the ski hut at Martin he won his fame
He started on his journey at a quarter to four,
His comrades had been waiting since the night before,
He mounted to his boiler with an ax in his hand,
And started on the journey to the promised land.

Wild Bill Maxwell mounted to his boiler,
Wild Bill Maxwell an ax in his hand,
Wild Bill Maxwell mounted to his boiler,
And started on his journey to the promised land.

He looked at the gas and the gas was low,
Checked up the speed and the speed was slow,
He turned to his passengers, said "boys you'd better push"
Or we'll never get to Martin in time for mush.
Grind up your axes and make them sharp,
You're not going to work with no dog-gone harp,
We are going to have skiing at Martin yet!

Wild Bill Maxwell gonna cut some trees,
Wild Bill Maxwell work all day you bet,
Wild Bill Maxwell gonna cut some trees
For we're gonna have skiing at Martin yet

The snow came down and covered the ground,
Shouts of joy made the hills resound,
The skiers made merry on Meany Hill,
As they coasted down the lane cleaned off by Bill.
Wild Bill Maxwell met the evening train,
And said he thought it was going to rain,
"You should have come up sooner – why'd you stay away,
For we had good skiing on Saturday."

Wild Bill Maxwell, should have come up sooner,
Wild Bill Maxwell, why'd you stay away,
Wild Bill Maxwell, should have come up sooner,
For we had good skiing on Saturday.

Maxwell gave a cup for a downhill race,
And he himself tried hard to set the pace,
He led the rest down Meany hill,
'Til he hit a bump and took an awful spill.
He finished at the hut a very poor last,
Staggered to the judges and said with a gasp,
"I stopped on purpose and gave it up,
'Cause I didn't want to win my own darn cup."

Wild Bill Maxwell stopped on purpose,
Wild Bill Maxwell had to give it up,
Wild Bill Maxwell stopped on purpose,
Because he didn't want to win his own darn cup.

#### [Milestones from 75 years at Meany Lodge](Milestones-from-75-years-at-Meany-Lodge)

#### Two Boards


````
The years may have more than one season
But I can remember just one,
The time when the rivers are freezin?
And the mountains with whiteness are spun,
The snowflakes are falling so fast,
And winter has come now at last.

1st CHORUS
Two boards upon cold powder snow, Yo-ho!
What else does a man need to know?
Two boards upon cold powder snow, Yo-ho!
That's all that a man needs to know.

The hiss of your skis is a passion;
You cannot imagine a spill!
When, Bang! – there's a godawful gash in
The smooth shining track on the hill.
What's happened you can't understand;
There's two splintered skis in your hand.

2nd CHORUS
Two boards and some snow down your neck, Oh heck!
Your skis are a hell of a wreck.
Two boards and some snow down your neck, Oh heck!
Your skis are a hell of a wreck.

I care not if government taxes
Take everything else that I own;
Two hickory boards and some waxes
And I'm free in the mountains alone.
If death finally finds me in Spring,
Inscribe on my tomb what I sing:

1st chorus

#### [Zoo](Zoo)

A traditional Meany custom is to endearlingly name our mobile machinery after an appropriate animal. The zoo houses some of our animals and any at one time or another when they need some tending to. The zoo can also be used for sheltered activities such as [MOFA](MOFA) and the [Mushroom society's](Mushroom-Weekend) weekend for display tables, etc.

#### [Cat House](Cat-House)

It was built in 1980 just south of the Hut and the Industrial Park. It has three levels, the upper two are used for tools and parts storage. The main floor is a shop to support repairs on the Cat, the Rat, Mouse, and all the animals; therefore the name "Cat House". The committee has so far resisted the idea of installing a red light by the entrance. After the day's work was done it became the source of Walt Little's famous boxed "Spring Water", supplied by Franzia, which he supplied with a mischievous grin.

#### [TomCat](Tomcat)

Once there is snow on the ground the Bombardier snow tractor is used to haul everything, including skiers, the three miles from the parking lot up to the lodge. The cat was bought in 1960, when NPRR stopped its passenger train service to Meany. Legendary meanyite [Tom Van DeVanter](Tom-Van-DeVanter) has piloted hte cat from 1960 to 2002 (hence the name "Tomcat"). Tomcat is the most important support animal at Meany. The stories Tom and it have generated over the decards are too numerous to explore here, but compiled in a book they would make very colorful reading of man and machine and volunteers in the backcountry. Snow tractors have notoriously high maintenance requirements, and due to age and heavy use Tomcat is almost always in need of care. Original engine: Chrysler 252, flat head. New engine: Chevyrolet 292, six cylinder, installed in 1971. New transmission: Chevyrolet, installed in 1971. New belts: Meany manufactured, rock conveyor-Dacron, 1969. The frame was lengthened by about five feet in 1998 by Mike Lonergan. Total carrying capacity is about 100 people and their gear towed by ropes and in machine.

#### [Ox](Ox)

A four wheel drive, post WW II design 3/4 ton Dodge weapons carrier is used for hard labor in the summer and fall. An "A-frame" attachment can be mounted for heavy lifting. Unlike other oxen, it hibernates all winter under the tow hut - nose in - so that its winch is out of reach of potential thieves.

#### [Pack Rat](Pack-Rat)

This Thiokol snow tractor was scrounged up cheaply from BPA in 1977 for hill packing. It his now used as auxiliary transportation when [Tom Cat](Tomcat) is ailing or its load is too much. On ski lesson days it becomes "Munchkin Express" hauling kids up to their ski classes. A roller can be mounted on the rear for hill grooming.

#### Dozer

Owned by Meanyite [Bob Bentler](Bob-Bentler). This International Harvester TD6-61 (Diesel) was used to smooth out ski lesson terrain, prepare ground at Tombstone Canyon for laying culvert pipes and to grade roads.

#### [Dino](Dino)

This Logan Mfr. Corp. snow grooming machine was in use at the Snoqualmie ski area until the mid 1990's. Prior to its purchase by Meany it was refurbished at the factory in Colorado. It has a 6 cyl. diesel engine and is used to groom the accessible slopes at Meany and to plow the road towards the parking lot.

#### Mule

DR wheelbarrow with a 4 1/2 HP Tecumseh engine. With an aging Meany workparty volunteer base and youngsters not being too savvy with hard labor it became necessary to invest in this modern back saving machine.

#### Goat

DR Brush Cutter. Keeper: Dave Claar. This machine was purchased new and is used for brush control on ski terrain. With its 15 HP, 4 stroke Kawasaki engine and four forward and reverse gears it can devour shrubbery faster than 13 goats can.

#### Track Setter

Towed behind the [Mouse](Mouse) (snowmobile) it makes two parallel grooves in the snow, about 2 inches deep for cross country skiers, who enjoy the groovy skiing.

#### Peevee

Is used for nudging along or rolling logs, usually to provide better access for choker cables or chain saw. It is recommended not to operate this tool from the downhill side of a log.

#### Misery Whip (pre chainsaw era)

This 1/2 specimen used to be a two man felling saw used at Meany. You can make up your own story why there's only half of it left. Meanyite Mike Lonergan remembers the days of their use and might tell stories, if asked.

#### Swede Hook

This tool is used for carrying logs when machinery is not available. One or two persons may be on each side. Number of hooks and Swedes required depends on the size of logs and the strength of carriers.

#### Wedges

Used to persuade a tree to fall in the desired directoin by driving them into the backcut with the backside of an ax.

#### Maul

Designed for splitting firewood. The thin cutting edge penetrates the wood easily, and the thicker midsection forces the wood apart. The beefed up back can be beaten on with a sledge hammer. Note the curvaceous design as compared to a plain wedge.

#### Two Sided Ax

Was primarily used for cutting springboard notches and undercuts on trees to be felled. If one side gets dull the other can still be used. It also has a nice balanced feel. For the ambitious it can be used to cut two trees at the same time, one with the backswing and one with the foreswing.

#### Spurs and Belt

Accessories for climbing trees or wooden poles for limbing or installing stuff.

#### Fuel House

Built in 2001, it has two rooms, one for a 1500 gallon diesel tank for Dino, the hill grooming machine, and the other houses the gas tank for the tow hut engine.

#### [Gas House](Gas-Hut)

Gasoline refueling station for all our animals except Dino.

#### [Propane Hut](Propane-Hut)

Built in 2001. Tank capacity is 500 gallons and will last through a season. The tank replaces several smaller tanks, which were kept in the generator hut nearby and did not meet today's safety code requirements.

#### [Tow Hut](Tow-Hut)

Houses the driving machinery for Meany's "Mach Tow." Build in 1938. Present engine: 1960 6 cyl. 292 hp. Chevy. Total length of rope is 2500 feet. Length of uphill trip is about 1000 feet with about 420 feet elevation gain. Presently used top speed is 16 mph, as allowed by state authority. Previously the top speed was 19+ mph, but it could and occasionally was shifted to 30 mph. When propelled up the hill at such speeds it seems as if one was approaching the speed of sound–hence the name "Mach Tow."<sup>[75th][]</sup>

#### [Mouse](Mouse)

This heavy duty 2-speed snowmobile was bought new by Al Alleman and donated to Meany. It's used for errands, individual transportation to worksites, etc. and thrills and chills. [Dave Claar](Dave-Claar) uses the mouse to tow the track setter for the groomed X-Country trail starting just below the hut. Can't come out now. It hibernates in summer.

#### [Generator Hut](Generator-Hut)

This gasoline engine driven 5,000 watt generator is used for emergency power when our normal power fails us due to inclement weather, accident or maintenance problems. This unit does not start automatic but must be started manually.
