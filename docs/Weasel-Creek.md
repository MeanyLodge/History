### Location

Forest Service road 420, on which the [Tom Cat](Tom-Cat) tracks its way back and forth, crosses this side creek at about 0.8 miles from Meany. <sup>[nw][]</sup>

### Origin

So named because the UW "Weasel" fell into it one Sunday night, and the efforts of all the University kids never did extract it. Some did not get home 'til 6 AM Monday. The "Weasel" served the [UW ski area](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Husky_Chalet) - long since discontinued. <sup>[nw][]</sup>
