One of the things which attracted the Mountaineers to the Meany site was the open slope area from the top of the Lane up to Meany Woods. This open area had been created by a big forest fire. Meany Woods was a general name for the untouched forest at the south and west sides of the burned area. <sup>[nw][]</sup>
