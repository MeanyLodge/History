    1. Herewith Meany outline history. It consolidates all my old notes, and I've added some from memory. Probably there are mistakes.
    2. Also, herewith is a revised property map.

### 1927

Mountaineer Skiers determined that another ski hut, additional to Snoqualmie Lodge, was needed. The background of this was to establish a string of mountain huts, similar to the Alps. The choices in 1927, had to be limited to areas served by railroads, There being no winter highways. A scouting committee traveled on the NorthernPacific Railroad (NPRR now BNSF), stayed overnight in a box car at the western end of the Stampede Pass tunnel, skied across Stampede Pass, and found a site on the East end of the tunnel. The site chosen was later found to be the location of the 1886-88 construction camp used for tunnel construction. It was called "Tunnel City"; later the name was changed to "Martin" when the NPRR established an operating base at the eastern portal of the tunnel.

### 1928

#### SUMMER

University of Washington Professor, Edmond S. Meany, was president of the Mountaineers' for 25 years. He was not a skier, however he purchased the land for the new cabin, 54 acres for $125 and donated it to the Mountaineers. Consequently the new cabin was named "Meany Ski Hut".
