### Mechanics
### History

#### 1994

Acquired from the factory in Logan, Utah Christmas 1994. The machine was at several ski areas before we bought it.

#### ????

- The tracks were rebelted.
- The machine came with a horrible electrical system with 3 different voltages. It was changed to a basic 12v system with a series/parallel switch for 24v starting. The high voltage system was removed.
- The high pressure hydraulic lines were replaced, usually in the snowbank.
- One of the final drive axles broke and was not available. We could have had some custom fabricated, but at that point tiller technology had improved enough people decided it was better to contract with the local trail groomer.

#### 2003

This Logan Mfr. Corp. snow grooming machine was in use at the Snoqualmie ski area until the mid 1990's. Prior to its purchase by Meany it was refurbished at the factory in Colorado. It has a 6 cyl. diesel engine and is used to groom the accessible slopes at Meany and to plow the road towards the parking lot.<sup>[75th][]</sup>

Dino was a LMC 4700 which was powered by an 11 liter Scania diesel engine.  It had an Eastern tiller and multi function blade.  It was model year 1983, serial 0011, and acquired from the factory in Logan, Utah Christmas 1994.  We paid about $10k for it.  It was purchased to improve the quality of grooming.  The machine was at several ski areas before we bought the machine.  The tracks were rebelted.  The machine came with a horrible electrical system with 3 different voltages.  It was changed to a basic 12v system with a series/parallel switch for 24v starting.  The high voltage system was removed.  The high pressure hydraulic lines were replaced, usually in the snowbank.  One of the final drive axles broke and was not available.  We could have had some custom fabricated, but at that point tiller technology had improved enough people decided it was better to contract with the local trail groomer.  So, the unit was sold about 2006.  I was not involved in the sale, so do not have any back up paperwork. --[Mike Lonergan](/Person/Mike-Lonergan)
