#### Sharpening & Maintenance

Hi Matt. To answer your question:

New blades cost about $100 from DR and about $80 when on sale as they are now. You will need the model and serial number of the machine to get the right blade Note: the machines are listed under my or Phyllis's name at DR.

To sharpen the blade cost about $10 and they can be sharpened about 10-15 times before there is not enough of the blade to work well. The blades are quite hard and do not sharpen by hand well. I get the blades sharpened at the [Eastside Saw Shop in Bellevue - 12880 Bel-Red Rd Bellevue WA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/12880+Bel-Red+Rd,+Bellevue,+WA+98005/@47.6218516,-122.1706439,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x54906cf874beb23d:0xe849ad2889ed36e8!8m2!3d47.6218516!4d-122.1684552) (425-861-7777). It is the only place that I know near me that can sharpen the blades. Not all shops can sharpen the blades because the metal is so hard.

If you get them sharpened be sure to mention it is for a chipper and not a planer. The difference is that they will sharpen out all the nicks for the planer, if they don't know, and use up more metal resulting in fewer times you can sharpen it.

You should also get new bolts and nuts and use the new bolts and nuts each time you change out the blades. I get the bolts and nuts from Tacoma Screw which have locations in quite a few places. There is one near me in Kirkland. Be sure to get the right size. The chippers use different size bolts depending on the model (my machine uses 1-1/2 inch bolt which should be the same as the Meany machine.

I have several blades and save the dull ones up until I get several dull ones they take them in.

Hope this helps.
