### History

#### 1977

Purchased Thiokol Spryte snow tractor at government auction to be used as hill packer. Constructed roller out of corrugated iron culvert pipe. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

- For purpose of packing snow, purchased Thiokol Sprite at GSA auction complete w/highway trailer for $4,000 <sup>[hw][]</sup>
- Sold trailer for $1,200
- Installed governor on engine, Ford Industrial 170ci, 4 cyl
- Construct roller of galvanized corrugated iron, 30" diameter x 10'

#### 1978

Maintaining the equipment has taken an enormous number of volunteer hours...[Tomcat](/Machine/Tomcat)...Meany's newest crew member, a Thiokol Spryte Sno-cat which now packs Meany's lower slopes, takes hours of service time. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1980

many modifications were made to the Thiokol. In short, the Thiokol was stripped and repainted; a new shift linkage was installed; a new instrument panel was fabricated; and a new transmission was added. All of this required much creative adaptation of the whole Thiokol system by some brilliant minds. <sup>[ma80][]</sup>

Replace rubber track belts. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1982

- New concrete slab 16' X 20' to facilitate maintenance on [Pack-Rat](/Machine/Pack-Rat). <sup>[hw][]</sup>
- Remove and service differential and rear axles.

#### 1983

install new radiator. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1988

The Thiokol (Pack Rat) transmission was rebuilt. <sup>[hr][]</sup>

#### 2003

This Thiokol snow tractor was scrounged up cheaply from BPA in 1977 for hill packing. It his now used as auxiliary transportation when [Tom Cat](/Machine/Tomcat) is ailing or its load is too much. On ski lesson days it becomes "Munchkin Express" hauling kids up to their ski classes. A roller can be mounted on the rear for hill grooming.<sup>[75th][]</sup>

Engine: industrial version of the Ford Falcon engine, a 165 --[Phil Christy](/Person/Phil-Christy)

Pack Rat was a 1967 Thiokol Spryte acquired in summer of 1977 at a GSA auction in Portland, OR. The original owner was Bonneville Power Admin. The fellows paid about $3000 at the auction and that included a trailer. Meany had no need for a trailer, so it was sold within a few days for $1500 or so. It had a blade and was powered by a 170 cubic inch 6 cylinder Ford gasoline industrial engine. It was acquired to groom the hill, so a roller was fabricated and it performed this duty for many years. The blade was too much for the machine, so the blade and hydraulic system were removed. The OC3 differential had an integral transmission that was terrible. So, the transmission was removed and a 4 speed syncromesh transmission was put on the back of the engine. The OC3 and axles were always a weak link. Thiokol only used the OC3 for a couple years and then changed to the OC12 which it used for many years. We were never able to do a retrofit. The tracks came with 1/4" bolts which were too weak. They were changed to 5/16" and finally to 3/8" which worked well. The track belting was replaced and the grousers lengthened. The differential and frame were tired with differential parts almost impossible to get by 2012, so the machine was sold to a farmer in eastern Oregon. [Paul Bergman](/Person/Paul-Bergman) was the primary caretaker of this machine for many years. --[Mike Lonergan](/Person/Mike-Lonergan)
