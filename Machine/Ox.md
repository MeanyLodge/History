### History

#### 1966

Purchased 4-wheel drive Dodge Power Wagon, affectionately called the Ox, to use in summer work; cost $200. Welded broken frame and ground valves. <sup>[ma78][], [hw][]</sup>

Walt bought it and Mike brought it up to Meany.

#### 1982

Repaired brakes. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

During work party season, Meany women took charge of the "Ox" and the two hill "brush" saws. Thanks to the gals, the whole lane, from top to bottom, had been brushed. This took two year to do but it is now skiable on six inches of snow! The ladies on the "Ox" lifted and hauled firewood, propane tanks, giant pumpkins, dozens of mattresses, Cat ski boxes, tractor treads, brush, garbage, you name it. Meanwhile, Meany men overhauled both tractors (Sno-cats). <sup>[hr][]</sup>

#### 1987

An extension boom was built on Ox to lift machinery for all the tow work. <sup>[hr][]</sup>


#### 1988

Replaced frame with frame from wrecked truck in Othello, plus much maintenance. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 2003

A four wheel drive, post WW II design 3/4 ton Dodge weapons carrier is used for hard labor in the summer and fall. An "A-frame" attachment can be mounted for heavy lifting. Unlike other oxen, it hibernates all winter under the tow hut - nose in - so that its winch is out of reach of potential thieves.<sup>[75th][]</sup>
