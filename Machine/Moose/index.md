### History

#### 2008

The Moose was purchased in summer 2008 from a rancher in the Tahoe area who used it to winter thin timber on his property. He bought it from Sno Trans who got it from the state of Oregon. The machine carries a Bombardier model number, but was actually custom built for Oregon. Bombardier used it as a prototype/test bed for their BR400 groomer. The fellow in Oregon who took care of the machine passed away about the time we received the machine, so his documentation etc are gone. Bombardier did not maintain any records on the machine as the successor companies only maintained records on newer machines that were main line production models. --[Mike Lonergan](/Person/Mike-Lonergan), May 2020

#### 200?

Dan Solemnson overhauled the hydraulics, rebuilt the deck and frame as well as many other maintenance items. --[Ray Nelson](/Person/Ray-Nelson) via email May 2020

#### 2011

Moose running the [Munchkin Express](/Munchkin-Express).

#### 2016

Moose had a total electrical meltdown. Lost all power. --[Rick Ingham](/Person/Rick-Ingham)

#### 2017

[Rick Ingham](/Person/Rick-Ingham) & [Shawn Bertagnole](/Person/Shawn-Bertagnole) replaced the starter and discovered a set of bad circuit breakers that had to be replaced. Discovered all the wiring to lights had been removed. Removed and rewired most of the machine, installed a master battery switch. --[Rick Ingham](/Person/Rick-Ingham)

- mounted an eBay acquired ($100) ether injector for starting

#### 2019

[Alex-De-Klerk](/Person/Alex-de-Klerk) removed, had repaired, and installed the hydraulic tank. Replaced the alternator. --[Rick Ingham](/Person/Rick-Ingham)

#### 2020

No one at Meany maintained any real records on the machine. Dan Solemnson documented the hydraulics, but had a stroke and his records were no longer accessible. The track belts were replaced. The frame had several phases of repair and reinforcement. The rest of the maintenance was limited to tires, grousers, etc as needed. The starter was weak and the machine was not used much until Shawn changed the starter. I do not know anything more recent. --[Mike Lonergan](/Person/Mike-Lonergan), May 2020

my recollection was about 10 years ago for $15k, with another $15k put into it... But don't quote me --[Shawn Bertagnole](/Person/Shawn-Bertagnole) May 2020

the estimates of purchase and maintenance are pretty good. --[Chuck Welter](/Person/Chuck-Welter) May 2020

Rick and Dick Hugget replaced the heater cores and fans. --[Rick Ingham](/Person/Rick-Ingham)

#### 2021

Shawn & Rick replaced the starter with a newer generation direct replacement fully sealed gear reduction starter, reducing the load on the battery. --[Rick Ingham](/Person/Rick-Ingham)
