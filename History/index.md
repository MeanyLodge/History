# Meany Lodge History

This is a chronological history compiled from [many sources](/Sources).

### 1884

The charred and blackened snags left by the fire of 1884...<sup>[ma55][]</sup>

### 1910s

Meany's development is inter-woven with the growth of skiing in the northwest, beginning about 1915-16, the centers of activity being [Snoqualmie Lodge](/Building/Snoqualmie-Lodge) and Paradise. Special outings at Stampede led by our early skiers over the pass to Martin where the favorable terrain and accessibility by train (no backpacking!) impressed them. These early explorers were enthused by the open areas around the present weather station, the power line hill, and the magnificent open timber of [Meany Hill](/Meany-Hill). <sup>[ma56][]</sup>

First interest of the country around was due to the vast area of denuded hills on Meany Hill and around Stampede Pass. As the forest grew these sections became less usable. <sup>[ma56][]</sup>

### 1920s

Mountaineers skied in the area, with excursions (Patrols) from [Snoqualmie Lodge](/Building/Snoqualmie-Lodge) and the Stampede Pass and Martin rail stations.

Skiers from [Cle Elum frequently visited Martin](https://www.historylink.org/File/10615).

### 1927

During the winter of 1927, the Mountaineers lodge at Snoqualmie was [filled to over-flowing for the first time](/History/The-Development-of-Skiing-in-the-Mountaineers), nearly every weekend. A committee led by [Ernest Harris](/Person/Ernest-Harris) began [planning for a another lodge][hut] to primarily serve the skiing community.

Following the winter of 1927-28 further explorations of the area led to a favorable decision.<sup>[ma56][]</sup>

Mountaineer Skiers determined that another ski hut, additional to Snoqualmie Lodge, was needed. The background of this was to establish a string of mountain huts, similar to the Alps. The choices in 1927, had to be limited to areas served by railroads, There being no winter highways. A scouting committee traveled on the NorthernPacific Railroad (NPRR now BNSF), stayed overnight in a box car at the western end of the Stampede Pass tunnel, skied across Stampede Pass, and found a site on the East end of the tunnel. The site chosen was later found to be the location of the 1886-88 construction camp used for tunnel construction. It was called "Tunnel City"; later the name was changed to "Martin" when the NPRR established an operating base at the eastern portal of the tunnel.<sup>[hw][]</sup>

### 1928

[Ernest Harris](/Person/Ernest-Harris)'s committee selected the Martin site and Dr. [Edmond S. Meany](/Person/Edmond-S.-Meany) purchased it for $125 and donated it to the Mountaineers. In June 1928 plans for a 20x50 two-story frame building to accommodate 50 people were approved and $1,700 was appropriated for construction. <sup>[ma56][]</sup> Generous donations were made by the Everett and Tacoma branches. Lumber was purchased from the Cabin Creek Sawmill.<sup>[hw][]</sup> Materials were shipped by rail to Martin, unloaded by the enthusiastic volunteer workers and carried uphill 300 yards <sup>[ma78][]</sup> to the site by hand. Construction was started in September and dedicated on November 11.

Meany Ski Hut opened for skiing in the winter of 1928/29.

A frame building. One enters the front door and discovers a long, well lit spacious room with easy staircases running up either end to dorms on the second story. An open kitchen at the far side, tables and benches sprawl about the room and canvas-back easy chairs invite one to sit near the round-bellied heating stove. The lofty dorms have 52 spring double decker bunks and new mattresses. There are sinks with hot running water, mirrors aplenty and hooks to one's heart's content.<sup>[hut][]</sup>
