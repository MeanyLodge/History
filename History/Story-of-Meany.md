Probably few of the skiers who use Meany Hut today are aware that the 60-acre site was a gift from our revered president, Dr. Edmond S. Meany. This was in 1928-long before the advent of many of its present devotees.

The story of Meany's development is inter-woven with the growth of skiing in the northwest which began about 1915-16, the centers of activity being Snoqualmie Lodge and Paradise. By 1926-27, however, the sport had become so popular that Snoqualmie Lodge was bursting with skiers throughout the winter and more facilities were needed.

Special outings at Stampede led some of our early skiers over the pass to the Meany area where the favorable terrain and accessibility by train (no backpacking!) impressed them. These early explorers were enthused by the open areas around the present weather station, the power line hill, and the magnificent open timber of [Meany Hill](/Meany-Hill)-all ideally suited to the ski touring which dominated the sport.

Following the winter of 1927-28 further explorations of the area led to a favorable decision and in June 1928 plans for the building were presented to a special meeting of the Board of Trustees. These plans called for a 20x50 two-story frame building to accommodate 50 people. It was to be a plain ski shelter without luxurious embellishments. (The total absence of these could be verified by any of the early visitors having occasion to arise in the night.) The project was approved and $1,700 appropriated for construction.

Dr. Meany purchased and donated the land, approximately 64 acres. Generous donations were also made by the Everett and Tacoma branches. Materials were shipped by rail to Martin, unloaded by the enthusiastic volunteer workers and carried to the site by hand, some help from the railroad section hands through the skillful cajolery of [W. J. Maxwell](/Person/Bill-Maxwell) plus a small cash consideration.

Construction was started in September 1928 and on November 11 the building was dedicated by Dr. Meany with about 100 members and guests present. Much interior work remained to be done but by the time winter arrived the hut was ready for occupancy and was filled to capacity throughout the season. While rough, it was comfortable, with the big hotel range in the kitchen and the potbellied coal stove in the main room giving off a cheery glow; on the wire rack overhead wet socks, mittens and other gear dried or nicely browned, depending on the owner's alertness. Gasoline lanterns furnished light but after a day of climbing up and sliding down the hills, early to bed was the rule, for tomorrow was another day. Those fortunate ones who could come on the Friday evening or Saturday morning train formed a welcoming committee with hot chocolate and doughnuts for the less fortunate arriving Saturday night. A brief visit and exchange of greetings around the big stove and then "lights out!"

The winters of 1928-31 were devoted to touring the surrounding country. Numerous trips were made to [Meany Hill](/Meany-Hill), the telephone cabin, Stampede Pass, Baldy, and Stirrup Lake. Snowshoe Butte was claimed but never substantiated.

These winters also saw the beginning of ski races at Meany. The cross-country races for men and women for the University Book Store trophies began in 1929. The slalom and downhill races for men began in 1930, for trophies donated by [Bob Hayes](/Person/Robert-Hayes) and [W. J. Maxwell](/Person/Bill-Maxwell), respectively. The first patrol race was also run this year, finishing at Meany.

This pattern of activity continued for the next several years, the tours expanding until trips from the Lodge to Meany or vice versa became almost commonplace, a party of public-spirited members having marked the route by orange-colored tin shingles high on trees and placed so that one was always in sight ahead.

The intervening summers were spent in clearing [Hell's Half-acre](/Area/Hell's-Half-acre), laying and relaying water lines and other necessary work. In 1931 two loggers from Easton contracted to fall the trees from the cornice down to the clearing for $100 and so the lane was created. Unfortunately the loggers were careless, or the trees perverse, for they fell in a jumble, requiring an outlay of another $100 the following summer to clean up the slash and reduce the fire hazard, which also improved the skiability.

At first the lower lane was used as a practice slope, the remainder being only a convenient means of going to and from the upper slopes of [Meany Hill](/Meany-Hill). The more expert used its entire length to some extent but three or four climbs and descents were enough for even the strongest on any one day.

The downhill races started at the edge of the timber near the top of [Meany Hill](/Meany-Hill), each man choosing his own course to the finish at the bottom of the lane. Always some tried to "run it straight" and some spectacular eggbeaters resulted but strangely enough there were never any serious injuries. As a deterrent to such folly the overhead beam in [The Hut](/Lodge) had an array of broken skis mounted on it and over them the warning: "THEY TOOK IT STRAIGHT."

A mysterious schism among the skiers developed with the advent of the ski hut. [Snoqualmie Lodge](/Building/Snoqualmie-Lodge) was a place of gaiety and entertainment as well as skiing, with its huge fireplace, phonograph and space enough for dancing. Meany Hut, however, was conceived and approved as strictly a shelter for skiers, with no fireplace or extra space. There was plenty of gaiety and fun but of a different kind and apparently this difference caused some to prefer one place to the other. Thus, while there were those who alternated, the skiers in general were identified as either "Lodge hounds" or "Meanyites."

Almost imperceptibly through these years changes were developing in the pattern of Meany activities. Slalom proficiency, at first sought chiefly as an aid to touring, began to emerge as an end unto itself. Rope tows were appearing in more and more areas, and as they increased, touring declined, finally bringing a major change in the Meany way of life. Again the members labored mightily and by the winter of 1938-39 a rope tow was completed, with a 15x20-foot log cabin to house its tractor power plant.

Also the original conception of the hut as merely a shelter no longer met the popular demand. More active indoor entertainment required more space and so the second major change was made--the hut had its face lifted. In 1939 another concerted effort resulted in a 24x30-foot, three story addition with a basement containing a furnace, drying room, waxing room, washroom, and - at last! - inside plumbing.

The main floor comprised a recreation room, with a ping-pong table, a phonograph and space for dancing or games. The second floor became sleeping quarters for men, the third floor comprising another innovation-married quarters. The addition increased the hut capacity to 75 people. A light plant had previously been installed and so life at Meany had indeed changed considerably.

During the early years it was difficult to find a suitable cook who could be available regularly. In 1935 the committee induced the one and only Nashie to take over and she has become a fixture as well as friend, counselor and confessor. Long may she reign!

Hut committees, in the early years had excellent cooperation from the railroad and in turn worked closely with it. Train schedules were convenient, allowing a full day of skiing plus time for dinner and cleanup. A special car was provided for parties of 15 or more and permitted all kinds of impromptu entertainment. Fares were high at first, around $3.80 a round trip, but were negotiated downward from time to time to a low of $1.80.

However during the war years extra cars were not available and fares went up again. By this time the highways had been improved to the point that access by automobile was feasible. Also train schedules had been changed from time to time and were no longer so convenient, so travel by automobile became increasingly popular. At this writing it is rumored that other changes in train schedules are being considered which would very likely see the end of rail transportation to Meany and complete another major change in former customs.

Over the years Meany Ski Hut has become more than just "a good place to ski." It has become a monument and a continuing tribute to Mountaineer tradition and to the many who devoted their time, thought and energy to its creation and its development from the beginning down through the years to the present. May it continue to be so!
