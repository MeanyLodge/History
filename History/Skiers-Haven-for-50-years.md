Artist's Conception of Meany Hut at Present

Meany Hut – A Skiers' Haven for Fifty Years by Idona Kellogg
The Mountaineer, August, 1978, p. 4

Hundreds of pigtailed Chinese railroad workers once roamed the hills around Meany Ski Area along with scores of other men, 400 horses and mules and a few families. They were all working on construction, from 1886 to 1888, of the two-mile long Stampede Pass Train Tunnel and temporary switchbacks. Tunnel City, with its workshops, warehouses, hospital, restaurant and saloon, stood somewhere on or near the site of the present Meany Hut. Given the absence of suitable flat areas even today, one wonders where these buildings stood.

All that existed of Tunnel City in 1928, when Professor Meany and one hundred other Mountaineers dedicated Meany Hut, was a station house labeled "Martin" and a few employees' cottages. Train service to Meany ceased in 1960 and shortly afterwards the station house and cottages were torn down. Very little remains to remind one of the epic struggle to build the tunnel. The old grades of the switchbacks have been almost obliterated by power lines and their access roads. However, the waterfall at the east portal still cascades over the tunnel's end and a snow shed protects the approach as it did in construction days. These can be seen from the ski traverse call the "Psychopath" at the back of Meany ski area.

The scene is peaceful now. Meany Hut nestles in a little grove of young evergreens, pine, hemlock, fir and yew, while nearby Meany Hill offers sweeping views into Keechelus and Kachess country. Encircling the horizon are friendly, rounded forested mountains. Acres of huckleberry and mountain ash in season color the landscape in every direction.

Such is the setting for the half-century birthday party on September 23-24. Perhaps a thousand Mountaineers will gather for the anniversary program. We hope they will include members from all branches and activities, Meany Old Timers and all former Hut chairmen, as well as special guests.

Fifty years ago, when Dr. Edmond S. Meany, Univer sity of Washington professor and beloved Mountaineer president, purchased and donated the land for a ski shelter, volunteer labor erected a 20' × 50' two-story frame building in less than two months. Materials for the building, which was to accommodate 50 people, were shipped by rail to Martin, 300 yards downhill from Meany, and carried to the site by hand.

It's still the volunteer labor that makes Meany successful. The hut seems to attract talented, spirited, hard-working, self-sufficient folk who love the challenge of a group project. Because of a core of dedicated "Meanyites" throughout its fifty-year history, the original hut and 64-acre plot have undergone many changes and improvements.

Engineer Walt Little, who has been part of the Meany picture for forty of its fifty years, tells about some of these additions.

"A major change," says Walt, "is the addition of two rope tows. The fast one we call the 'Mach' Tow referring to the 'speed of sound' and the other the 'worm' tow because it crawls."

Before the first tow was built in 1938, even the strongest skiers could only manage three or four climbs and descents of Meany Hill on any one day. Many devoted their time to touring the surrounding country.
Ski races at Meany were popular, with cross-country and slalom races for men and women and downhill races for men. Then there was the "patrol race.

The race route led cross-country from Snoqualmie Lodge to Meany, a distance of over 22 miles. Teams were started about 10 minutes apart and the three men or women of each team were required to go over the finish line at Meany within one minute of each other. Dawn Steere's picture album shows that in 1938 the Meany men's team beat six teams from other ski clubs by making the trip in 4 hours, 57 minutes! The usual time was between 5 and 6 hours. Dawn was on one of the women's teams.

'Access to Meany in wintertime is now by Sno-cat," Walt Little continued.

Imagine the surprise of some people when they see coming toward them two long lines of skiers with overnight packs being pulled by a gaily-painted blue-topped Bombadier Cat. Aboard the "Cat" are another 20 or more people and gear.

Tom Van DeVanter has driven the Cat on scheduled Saturday and Sunday runs since 1960 when the trains could no longer stop at Meany. A few people hike, cross-country ski, or snowshoe the three miles in to Meany from the Stampede Pass Sno-Park area.

The Hut itself has seen some drastic changes," Walt Little stated as he listed a few.

In 1939 a concerted effort resulted in a 24' × 30' three-story addition with a basement containing a furnace, drying room, waxing room, washroom, and --at last!--inside plumbing. The main floor held a recreation room with a ping-pong table and space for dancing or games. Dorm space was almost doubled. A light plant had previously been installed and, later, telephone service was added.

"Our ski area has expanded considerably," Walt commented. "The government considers 'Lower Slob. bovia' a transmission line, but it makes a dandy ski hill.»

In his article for the 1956 Annual, "[The Story of Meany Ski Hut](/History/Story-of-Meany)," Fred W. Ball wrote that "In 1931 two loggers from Easton contracted to fall the trees from the cornice down to the clearing for $100 and so the lane was created. Unfortunately the loggers were careless, or the trees perverse, for they fell in a jumble, requiring an outlay of another $100 the following summer to clean up the slash and reduce the fire hazard, which also improved the skiability."

Other ski runs have since been opened up.

"The Packrat," a Thiokol Spryte Sno-Cat, was added to the Meany workforce this past winter. With the Thiokol, Paul Bergman and his crew were able to groom the lower slopes, enabling many to handle snow conditions previously managed only by the experts.

Many unique activities have developed at Meany. One of them, "Pack the Hill," involves sideslipping an ungroomed area when adverse snow conditions dictate.

Then there is the "Kitchen Run," where daring skiers take a straight shot for the kitchen's back door when heading for lunch. It's quite a jump if you're going fast enough.

The Carnival Weekend has been a big favorite with numerous crazy races and corny contests. It comes complete with prizes, clowns and a colorful awards banquet.

On a normal weekend it's not unusual to see the skiers playing "gates." Each skiers swishes around the other skiers and then becomes a slalom pole himself.

For the hardy and adventurous ones, there is "tube hockey" which consists of two teams attempting to pursue a "puck" down the hill and through a goal. The puck is an innertube in a heavy canvas bag. Behind on the hill a jumble of skiers is often left, replacing their bindings and collecting their gear.

Ski lessons under the direction of certified ski instructor Patti Polinsky-Claar, assisted by her husband Dave, have been given the last few years with very satisfying results.

The year there was no snow "Meanyites" went ice skating on a nearby lake.

Improvised bits of fun frequently happen in the lodge - everything from making gingerbread houses, to copper enameling, to the usual folkdancing and games.

Much of Meany's action is captured on film by Bob Bentler and replayed each weekend as "Saturday Night Movies."

The Hut has an ingenious cook, Peggy Grass, but most of the meal preperation and housekeeping tasks are done by workshifts, with each memeber taking his "turn." Ray Nelson, Hut Chairman, has smoothly coordinated lodge activities and projects for the past twelve years.

Meany's history is not yet complete. Stories of past people and events, names and addresses of Meany Old Timers, photos and other mementos are wanted. Contact Wanda Van DeVanter or Walt Little with such information.
