DEDICATION OF OUR NEW SKI HUT, NOVEMBER 11, 1928

At last the dream of The Mountaineers has been realized. The Club possesses a real Ski Hut. The two story building at Martin is finished. Stoves for cooking and heating have been installed. There are dishes on the shelves, tables for meals, benches to sit on, and steel double-tier bunks and new mattresses in the sleeping quarters. Every weekend of the past two months has seen a group of enthusiastic Mountaineers laboring as carpenters, masons, pack-horses, and thanks to their efforts the Hut is now ready for occupancy.

Dedication exercises will be held at the Hut on Sunday, November 11, 1928. Doctor Edmond S. Meany will preside.

Providing 130 sign up, a special train will be chartered, leaving King Street Station at 8 a. m. The Dedication ceremony will take place shortly after lunch, and the special train will not leave Martin until about 4 p. m. It will arrive in Seattle about 7:30 p. m. This will leave free time for everyone to add his bit to the work remaining-so bring along a hand axe for brushing out trails-a hammer or other tool.

Expense on the special train will be $2.85 round trip fare from Seattle and $2.70
from Tacoma, plus fifty cents for the hot lunch served at the Hut.

About 50 persons can be accommodated for overnight. The total expense for overnight at the Hut will be $1.50. Regular trains leave King Street Station, Saturday, 4 p. m. and arrive at Martin at 7:15 p.m. where a hot dinner will be served on arrival. A fast train leaves King Street Station at 7:15 p. m., arriving at Martin at 10 p. m. We can obtain a special stop order on this train if six or more passengers are ticketed for Martin. Fare on these trains is $3.60 for the round trip from Seattle.

Members of the overnight party bring sleeping equipment and flash or bug.

Other committees have cooperated to keep this date, November 11, free for the Dedication-so all aboard for Martin! Sign up with your nearest Hut representative and make the special train a certainty.

All reservations must be in before 9 p. m., Thursday, November 8.

One feature of the Dedication Ceremonies will be a Potlatch for the infant Hut.
Cooking utensils and dishes are already provided, also a First Aid Kit. But we crave a gorgeous, generous, comprehensive, presentation of almost any tool you can spare from your basement, garage, or tool-chest. Dig them up, polish and sharpen them if necessary, present them to the Hut and receive the blessings of future ski generations.

Buckles, straps, rivets, shoe nails, shoe last, etc., may be included in this Potlatch.

December 1, 2, 1928.

If snow conditions are favorable, a ski party will be put on at the Hut, with proportionate reservations from Everett, Tacoma, and Seattle. Your Branch Committeemen will have the latest snow "dope", so keep in touch with

#### Meany Hut started as a ski-touring shelter

So greatly had the enthusiasm for ski-touring grown in the twenties that in 1927 plans were made for a second Mountaineer Club base to care for the overflow from Snoqualmie Lodge. This refuge was to be the forerunner of several huts scattered at a day's trek from one another, as in ski-wise Europe and the Appalachians.

Early explorers were impressed by the open areas around the present Stampede Pass weather station, the power line slopes, and the magnificent open timber of Meany Hill-all ideally suited to ski-touring. This favorable terrain plus accessibility by train (no backpacking) influenced Dr. Edmond S. Meany, beloved president of The Mountaineers from 1908 to 1935 and a University of Washington Professor, to purchase and donate 64 acres close to the former site of Tunnel City, which had housed 156 men and six families during construction of the two-mile Northern Pacific Stampede Pass train tunnel and switchbacks during the years 1886-1888.

A station house labeled "Martin" replaced Tunnel City and its workshops, warehouses, hospital, restaurant and saloon. The Meany Ski Hut was to be erected only a five minutes' walk from the Martin station house.

Construction of the 20 by 50 two-story frame building large enough for fifty people was started in September, 1928. Materials were shipped by rail to Martin, unloaded by volunteer workers and carried to the site by hand, with some help from railroad section hands. On November 11 the building was dedicated by Dr. Meany with about 100 members and guests present.
Train service ceased in 1960, and the Martin station house was torn down shortly after.


#### Gigantic Half–Century Birthday Party

by Idona Kellogg

Meany Hut, Sept 23-24

Plan your group's activities for Meany Hill Sept. 23-24, Meany's 50th Anniversary celebration. We are envisioning one thousand guests using our hill as base camp for hikes, climbs, canoe-kayak trips, bicycle tours, naturalist trips, folkdancing, music making, player events, etc.

This will mean campsites from "No-Name-Woods" to "the
"Edifice Wreck" and all along the "Cat Trail". Some daring souls might even venture to "Tombstone Canyon", "Psychopath", "Phogbound Gulch", or "North or South Slobovia".

We will clear the entire main floor of Meany Hut for a Saturday night folkdance led by Arne Svensson. A campfire song fest is also flaring for Saturday eve.

Sunday will be the highlight - an "anniversary program" with skits, spiels, special guests, and much merriment and hilarity. Bring a ravenous appetite as an enormous outdoor barbecue will await you. (Tickets Purchased beforehand).

Does anyone have contributions to Meany's history - stories of past people or events, names and addresses of Meany Old Timers, photos or other mementos. Contact Wanda Van Decanter (827-5415) or Walt Little (322-255))

#### Packrat to Help Celebrate Birthday, Will You?

Meany Ski Hut will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary Sept. 23-24. Meany's newest hardworking regular, the Packrat, will be there. Will you? Hopefully every branch of the Mountaineers will schedule some event for Meany area that weekend and then participate Sunday in the anniversary program and outdoor barbecue.

The packrat is a nickname given Meany's new crew member, a Thiokol Spryte Sno-cat, which Paul Bergman has used all winter to pack Meany's lower slopes. It is like the sno-cats. used in commercial ski areas to groom the hills.

Since the packrat has changed skiing at Meany from ungroomed to semi-groomed, Meanyites treasure the machine. In its revered position, the packrat has become the subject of cartoons, such as the one drawn by artist Roy Nishiyori to be used on Meany T-shirts.

#### Meany Hut – A Skiers' Haven for Fifty Years by Idona Kellogg

Artist's Conception of Meany Hut at Present

Hundreds of pigtailed Chinese railroad workers once roamed the hills around Meany Ski Area along with scores of other men, 400 horses and mules and a few families. They were all working on construction, from 1886 to 1888, of the two-mile long Stampede Pass Train Tunnel and temporary switchbacks. Tunnel City, with its workshops, warehouses, hospital, restaurant and saloon, stood somewhere on or near the site of the present Meany Hut. Given the absence of suitable flat areas even today, one wonders where these buildings stood.

All that existed of Tunnel City in 1928, when Professor Meany and one hundred other Mountaineers dedicated Meany Hut, was a station house labeled "Martin" and a few employees' cottages. Train service to Meany ceased in 1960 and shortly afterwards the station house and cottages were torn down. Very little remains to remind one of the epic struggle to build the tunnel. The old grades of the switchbacks have been almost obliterated by power lines and their access roads. However, the waterfall at the east portal still cascades over the tunnel's end and a snow shed protects the approach as it did in construction days. These can be seen from the ski traverse call the "Psychopath" at the back of Meany ski area.

The scene is peaceful now. Meany Hut nestles in a little grove of young evergreens, pine, hemlock, fir and yew, while nearby Meany Hill offers sweeping views into Keechelus and Kachess country. Encircling the horizon are friendly, rounded forested mountains. Acres of huckleberry and mountain ash in season color the landscape in every direction.

Such is the setting for the half-century birthday party on September 23-24. Perhaps a thousand Mountaineers will gather for the anniversary program. We hope they will include members from all branches and activities, Meany Old Timers and all former Hut chairmen, as well as special guests.

Fifty years ago, when Dr. Edmond S. Meany, Univer sity of Washington professor and beloved Mountaineer president, purchased and donated the land for a ski shelter, volunteer labor erected a 20' × 50' two-story frame building in less than two months. Materials for the building, which was to accommodate 50 people, were shipped by rail to Martin, 300 yards downhill from Meany, and carried to the site by hand.

It's still the volunteer labor that makes Meany successful. The hut seems to attract talented, spirited, hard-working, self-sufficient folk who love the challenge of a group project. Because of a core of dedicated "Meanyites" throughout its fifty-year history, the original hut and 64-acre plot have undergone many changes and improvements.

Engineer Walt Little, who has been part of the Meany picture for forty of its fifty years, tells about some of these additions.

"A major change," says Walt, "is the addition of two rope tows. The fast one we call the 'Mach' Tow referring to the 'speed of sound' and the other the 'worm' tow because it crawls."

Meanyites behind the Sno-Cat

Before the first tow was built in 1938, even the strongest skiers could only manage three or four climbs and descents of Meany Hill on any one day. Many devoted their time to touring the surrounding country.
Ski races at Meany were popular, with cross-country and slalom races for men and women and downhill races for men. Then there was the "patrol race.

The race route led cross-country from Snoqualmie Lodge to Meany, a distance of over 22 miles. Teams were started about 10 minutes apart and the three men or women of each team were required to go over the finish line at Meany within one minute of each other. Dawn Steere's picture album shows that in 1938 the Meany men's team beat six teams from other ski clubs by making the trip in 4 hours, 57 minutes! The usual time was between 5 and 6 hours. Dawn was on one of the women's teams.

'Access to Meany in wintertime is now by Sno-cat," Walt Little continued.

Imagine the surprise of some people when they see coming toward them two long lines of skiers with overnight packs being pulled by a gaily-painted blue-topped Bombadier Cat. Aboard the "Cat" are another 20 or more people and gear.

Tom Van DeVanter has driven the Cat on scheduled Saturday and Sunday runs since 1960 when the trains could no longer stop at Meany. A few people hike, cross-country ski, or snowshoe the three miles in to Meany from the Stampede Pass Sno-Park area.

The Hut itself has seen some drastic changes," Walt Little stated as he listed a few.

In 1939 a concerted effort resulted in a 24' × 30' three-story addition with a basement containing a furnace, drying room, waxing room, washroom, and --at last!--inside plumbing. The main floor held a recreation room with a ping-pong table and space for dancing or games. Dorm space was almost doubled. A light plant had previously been installed and, later, telephone service was added.

"Our ski area has expanded considerably," Walt commented. "The government considers 'Lower Slob. bovia' a transmission line, but it makes a dandy ski hill.»

In his article for the 1956 Annual, "[The Story of Meany Ski Hut](/History/Story-of-Meany)," Fred W. Ball wrote that "In 1931 two loggers from Easton contracted to fall the trees from the cornice down to the clearing for $100 and so the lane was created. Unfortunately the loggers were careless, or the trees perverse, for they fell in a jumble, requiring an outlay of another $100 the following summer to clean up the slash and reduce the fire hazard, which also improved the skiability."

Other ski runs have since been opened up.

"The Packrat," a Thiokol Spryte Sno-Cat, was added to the Meany workforce this past winter. With the Thiokol, Paul Bergman and his crew were able to groom the lower slopes, enabling many to handle snow conditions previously managed only by the experts.

Many unique activities have developed at Meany. One of them, "Pack the Hill," involves sideslipping an ungroomed area when adverse snow conditions dictate.

Then there is the "Kitchen Run," where daring skiers take a straight shot for the kitchen's back door when heading for lunch. It's quite a jump if you're going fast enough.

The Carnival Weekend has been a big favorite with numerous crazy races and corny contests. It comes complete with prizes, clowns and a colorful awards banquet.

On a normal weekend it's not unusual to see the skiers playing "gates." Each skiers swishes around the other skiers and then becomes a slalom pole himself.

For the hardy and adventurous ones, there is "tube hockey" which consists of two teams attempting to pursue a "puck" down the hill and through a goal. The puck is an innertube in a heavy canvas bag. Behind on the hill a jumble of skiers is often left, replacing their bindings and collecting their gear.

Ski lessons under the direction of certified ski instructor Patti Polinsky-Claar, assisted by her husband Dave, have been given the last few years with very satisfying results.

The year there was no snow "Meanyites" went ice skating on a nearby lake.

Improvised bits of fun frequently happen in the lodge - everything from making gingerbread houses, to copper enameling, to the usual folkdancing and games.

Much of Meany's action is captured on film by Bob Bentler and replayed each weekend as "Saturday Night Movies."

The Hut has an ingenious cook, Peggy Grass, but most of the meal preperation and housekeeping tasks are done by workshifts, with each memeber taking his "turn." Ray Nelson, Hut Chairman, has smoothly coordinated lodge activities and projects for the past twelve years.

Meany's history is not yet complete. Stories of past people and events, names and addresses of Meany Old Timers, photos and other mementos are wanted. Contact Wanda Van DeVanter or Walt Little with such information.
