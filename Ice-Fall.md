# Ice Fall
### Location

Straight above [Edifice Wreck](Edifice-Wreck) is the bank that had to be climbed before crossing the railroad tracks.<sup>[n9][]</sup>

### Origin

After the trains ceased stopping at Martin in 1960, access to the Lodge was by snow cat. [Tom Cat](Tom-Cat) stopped below the tracks and people hiked (with gear and food) the final half-mile to the Lodge. This trip required a tricky crossing of the plowed tracks with their high berms.<sup>[n9][]</sup>
