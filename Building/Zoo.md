# Zoo
<img src="/img/2020-Zoo.jpeg" style="width: 40%;" align="right">

### Location

In the [Industrial Park](Industrial-Park).

### Purpose

The Zoo is the veterinary hospital for Meany [animals](Machines). In the Zoo, the [veterinarians](/Person/Mechanic) administer the TLC needed to keep them going. Since the Zoo is only big enough for one critter at a time, the [Machines](Machines) take turns breaking down. If you believe that one, we've got a Tom Cat differential we'd like to sell you.

### Events
- Construction: 1993

### History

#### 1984

Bulldozed area behind the [Cat House](/Building/Cat-House) to make a larger industrial area, losing [Kitchen Jump](/Run/Kitchen-Jump) in the process. <sup>[nw][]</sup>

#### 1993

Construction of the Zoo was led by [Mike Lonergan](/Person/Mike-Lonergan). The field work was completed in the fall of 1993 with a tracked loader and a backhoe. The building construction started on October 1st and was fully enclosed by the November work party. <sup>[wp93][]</sup>

Now that I dig through old notes, I believe the floor has welded wire mesh--I have no idea on gauge or spacing.  We did not have the money for rebar, we did not have the labor units to tie rebar, and we did not have a good way of transporting long loads. --[Mike Lonergan](/Person/Mike-Lonergan), May 2020

#### 2003

A traditional Meany custom is to endearlingly name our mobile machinery after an appropriate animal. The zoo houses some of our animals and any at one time or another when they need some tending to. The zoo can also be used for sheltered activities such as [MOFA](MOFA) and the [Mushroom society's](/Event/Mushroom-Weekend) weekend for display tables, etc.<sup>[75th][]</sup>

#### 2017
