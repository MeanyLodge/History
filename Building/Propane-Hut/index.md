### History

#### 2003

**Propane Hut**: Built in 2001. Tank capacity is 500 gallons and will last through a season. The tank replaces several smaller tanks, which were kept in the generator hut nearby and did not meet today's safety code requirements.<sup>[75th][]</sup>

#### 2NNN

Regulations changed again and propane tanks cannot be enclosed by any type of building.

#### 2019

During the winter, we store a couple of the Toads (ATV trailers) and whatever else
we can fit. During the summer, it stores building materials, project parts,
and miscellaneous.<sup>[ms][]</sup>
