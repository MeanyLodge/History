#### "Wild Bill Maxwell" to the tune of "Casey Jones"

Come on you scares if you want to hear
The story of a brave mountaineer
Wild Bill Maxwell was the skiers name
At the ski hut at Martin he won his fame
He started on his journey at a quarter to four,
His comrades had been waiting since the night before,
He mounted to his boiler with an ax in his hand,
And started on the journey to the promised land.

Wild Bill Maxwell mounted to his boiler,
Wild Bill Maxwell an ax in his hand,
Wild Bill Maxwell mounted to his boiler,
And started on his journey to the promised land.

He looked at the gas and the gas was low,
Checked up the speed and the speed was slow,
He turned to his passengers, said "boys you'd better push"
Or we'll never get to Martin in time for mush.
Grind up your axes and make them sharp,
You're not going to work with no dog-gone harp,
We are going to have skiing at Martin yet!

Wild Bill Maxwell gonna cut some trees,
Wild Bill Maxwell  work all day you bet,
Wild Bill Maxwell  gonna cut some trees
For we're gonna have skiing at Martin yet

The snow came down and covered the ground,
Shouts of joy made the hills resound,
The skiers made merry on Meany Hill,
As they coasted down the lane cleaned off by Bill.
Wild Bill Maxwell met the evening train,
And said he thought it was going to rain,
"You should have come up sooner â€“ why'd you stay away,
For we had good skiing on Saturday."

Wild Bill Maxwell, should have come up sooner,
Wild Bill Maxwell, why'd you stay away,
Wild Bill Maxwell, should have come up sooner,
For we had good skiing on Saturday.

Maxwell gave a cup for a downhill race,
And he himself tried hard to set the pace,
He led the rest down Meany hill,
'Til he hit a bump and took an awful spill.
He finished at the hut a very poor last,
Staggered to the judges and said with a gasp,
"I stopped on purpose and gave it up,
'Cause I didn't want to win my own darn cup."

Wild Bill Maxwell stopped on purpose,
Wild Bill Maxwell had to give it up,
Wild Bill Maxwell stopped on purpose,
Because he didn't want to win his own darn cup.<sup>[75th][]</sup>

### History
#### 1978

[Fred Ball](Fred-Ball), an energetic 81-year-old and the 1932 Hut Chairman, entertained the group by singing "Wild Bill Maxwell," a tale written by Art Winder in the 1930's about one of the best-loved and most colorful of Meany's early skiers. Much credit was given to "Max" for organizing the backbreaking labor necessary for building the Hut and clearing the [Lane](Lane). Maxwell's widow, Opal, proudly beamed in the audience as "Max's" story was told in song.<sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1998

Slalom and downhill races for men began that same year, with trophies donated by [Bob Hayes](Robert-Hayes) and Bill Maxwell. Maxwell, with a nickname of "Wild Bill" earned in part by his skiing technique, competed in the first race for the trophy he sponsored-and came in dead last. <sup>[Life At Meany][life]</sup>
