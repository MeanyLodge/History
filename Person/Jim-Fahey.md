### History
#### 2003

**Jim Fahey & son Gabe** This will be our fifth year skiing and boarding here at Meany. This place has already become a favorite memory of ours. Last season there was hardly enough snow to ski on. We had to take our skiis off and walk through the woods to the tow hut spot. Even with such little snow my son would say, "I don't care about the ski conditions, I just want to come up to Meany every weekend!" Me too!<sup>[75th][]</sup>

#### 2013

While the 80 guests in the lodge enjoyed a pancake breakfast, I followed ski instructor Jim Fahey to the tow house where Andy Smith was firing up Mach, the main lift. Fahey calls the tow house “a living museum,” and I immediately saw why. A still working — but barely-used — hand-crank phone hung just inside the door. Ropes, pulleys and tools hung from the walls...He puts the engine in third gear, which moves skiers up the hill at about 15 mph, the maximum speed allowed in Washington, Fahey said. Before high speed chairlifts necessitated speed limits, Fahey said the old engine ran in fourth gear moving skiers at 21 mph. <sup>[yore][]</sup>
