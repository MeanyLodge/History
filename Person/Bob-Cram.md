BPA constructed a 287 KV power line over portion of Meany property to south of rope tow; the cleared area made excellent skiing and added much variety.

For the Sunday Birthday Ceremony, Bob Cram, old-time Meanyite and well-known cartoonist and television personality, hosted a lively hour of laughter and nostalgia as he interviewed past Hut Chairmen about "interesting" events that occurred during their reign. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

Bob Cram's imitation of "Charlie's" jungle noises in the men's dorm had the crowd roaring. As Cram said, "He had no rhythm to his snoring." <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

Bob Cram said this of Walter Little, who has skied Meany for forty of its fifty years: "Walt was a pioneer in ski technique. Anything that was crazy Walt had already tried." Besides his many technical contributions Walt concocted many of the names around [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill) like "Psychopath" and "Lower Slobbovia". Walt, with his keen intellect, has helped create the friendly and witty Meany atmosphere. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>
