### History

Authored the Meany Hut map on the wall in the lodge.<sup>[map][]</sup>

#### 1978

"Times were really gloomy at Meany in early 1960," Doug Damm, Hut [Chairman](Chair) at that time, recounted. "The trains stopped in March, 1960 and the rest of that season supplies had to be hand-carried all the way from the highway." Doug hilariously told the story of a test run behind [Tom Van DeVanter](Tom-Van-DeVanter)'s station wagon to determine how people would react to being towed in by the Cat on ropes. Apparently after a speedy start, a little panic, and a frantic call to "STOP," Tom applied the brakes and the skiers all plowed into his open tailgate.<sup>[ma78][]</sup>
