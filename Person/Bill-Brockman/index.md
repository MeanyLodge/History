### History
#### 1952

Bill Brockman, assisted by [Dick Feringer](/Person/Dick-Feringer), has taken over the chairmanship for the coming season, and if the work parties are any criteria, it should be an enthusiastic one. With the combination of ideal weather and large groups of eager workers each weekend, a surprising amount has been accomplished.

#### 1978

Bill Brockman, 1953 Hut Chairman, told of some of the technical problems of getting highly-esteemed, over-weight "Nashie," the cook, up the hill each weekend.
