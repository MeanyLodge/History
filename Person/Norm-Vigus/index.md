#### 2020

One Sunday morning [Al](/Person/Al-Alleman) took me up to the Mt. Francis microwave towers and I skied down the clear cuts by myself coming out about 2 gullies beyond Walt's Woods. Don't know if I'd have the nerve to do that now but when you're young and invulnerable, early 40's or so. Also had memories of Al Alleman working the #2 rope at Stevens Pass in the mid/late 50's. --[Norm Vigus](/Person/Norm-Vigus)
