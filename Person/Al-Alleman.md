### History
#### 1981

On the light side, Al Alleman and Kent Nelson, amid great applause, were awarded the "Order of the Mole - Second Class" for excavating the three foot diameter by thirty foot long culvert of Weasel Creek which had collected debris for over four years. These two were told that if they wish to try for the Order of the Mole - First Class" they would have to dig a longer hole.<sup>[hr][]</sup>

#### 1982

The proportion of cross-country skiers using Meany Lodge continues to increase. Al Alleman graciously donates the time and expertise to show people the fabulous ski trails in Meany vicinity. During work party season Al's crew labors to improve these trails.<sup>[hr][]</sup>

#### 2020

One Sunday morning Al took me up to the Mt. Francis microwave towers and I skied down the clear cuts by myself coming out about 2 gullies beyond Walt's Woods. Don't know if I'd have the nerve to do that now but when you're young and invulnerable, early 40's or so. Also had memories of Al Alleman working the #2 rope at Stevens Pass in the mid/late 50's. --[Norm Vigus](/Person/Norm-Vigus)
