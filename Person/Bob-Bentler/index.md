"Another favorite pastime of Bob's was being a part of the Mountaineers Meany
Ski Lodge, a place he had built many longtime friendships and was able to ski
into his late 70's as well. One of the most prominent relationships made at
the Mountaineers was meeting his future wife and soul mate, Idona, in 1972,
and later married in 2006. Together they enjoyed a wonderful life skiing,
laughing and traveling to visit friends and family over 48 years."
