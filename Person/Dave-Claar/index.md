### History

#### 1977

The very popular lessons taught by [Patti Polinsky](/Person/Patti-Polinsky) and [Dave Claar](/Person/Dave-Claar) improved the techniques of beginners and advanced skiers alike. Lessons and "Family Weekend" brought many future juniors.<sup>[ma77][]</sup>

#### 1979

Other skit characters were the minister (Dave Claar) and the victim (Charlie Vail). [Walter Little](/Person/Walter-Little) walked away with the Bachelor of the Year Award with [Norm Vigus](/Person/Norm-Vigus) as runner-up. Bob Bentler showed Super 8 movies of Walt and Norm to prove why they should be the winners.<sup>[ma79][]</sup>

#### 1987

by Dave Claar, transcribed from handwritten note by [Matt Simerson](/Person/Matt-Simerson) in 2020.

Revision of the worm tow to [Super Worm](/Super-Worm) occurred in the summer of 1987. A new lower terminal was built approximately 50' further down the hill. Upper terminal remained in same location. Mechanical revisions were: speed increased to 800 feet per minute (9.1 MPH), upper terminal new rope track added, lower terminal completely new design. Many of parts for this tow donated by Crystal Mountain Inc. (Crystal's tows were originally modeled after the Meany [Mach](Mach) tow which was designed by [Walter Little](/Person/Walter-Little).

Snail Tow: New tow build in summer of 1986-1987 located SE of [Mach](Mach) tow. The driving machinery, transferred in tact, originally operated the [Worm](Worm) tow. This area was built to provide a new, safe, beginner tow area. This tow also has been called "The Slug" to keep in tune with the ferocious animals of the Meany Woods.

What I think of, when I think of Dave, is dedication. To Meany. To the cross-country trail system around our lodge, and the endless hours he has spent keeping these trails groomed. To the ski trips that Patti takes to Europe, with Dave providing so much of the day-to-day logistics, freeing Patti to ski with her guests. To the bunnies that he and Patti have rescued and raised. To the Mountaineers, particularly its property division. Dave is there. Where he needs to be. -- [Dan Nord](/Person/Dan-Nord)
