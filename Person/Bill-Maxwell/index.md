#### "Wild Bill Maxwell" to the tune of "Casey Jones"

Come on you scares if you want to hear
The story of a brave mountaineer
Wild Bill Maxwell was the skiers name
At the ski hut at Martin he won his fame
He started on his journey at a quarter to four,
His comrades had been waiting since the night before,
He mounted to his boiler with an ax in his hand,
And started on the journey to the promised land.

Wild Bill Maxwell mounted to his boiler,
Wild Bill Maxwell an ax in his hand,
Wild Bill Maxwell mounted to his boiler,
And started on his journey to the promised land.

He looked at the gas and the gas was low,
Checked up the speed and the speed was slow,
He turned to his passengers, said "boys you'd better push"
Or we'll never get to Martin in time for mush.
Grind up your axes and make them sharp,
You're not going to work with no dog-gone harp,
We are going to have skiing at Martin yet!

Wild Bill Maxwell gonna cut some trees,
Wild Bill Maxwell  work all day you bet,
Wild Bill Maxwell  gonna cut some trees
For we're gonna have skiing at Martin yet

The snow came down and covered the ground,
Shouts of joy made the hills resound,
The skiers made merry on Meany Hill,
As they coasted down the lane cleaned off by Bill.
Wild Bill Maxwell met the evening train,
And said he thought it was going to rain,
"You should have come up sooner â€“ why'd you stay away,
For we had good skiing on Saturday."

Wild Bill Maxwell, should have come up sooner,
Wild Bill Maxwell, why'd you stay away,
Wild Bill Maxwell, should have come up sooner,
For we had good skiing on Saturday.

Maxwell gave a cup for a downhill race,
And he himself tried hard to set the pace,
He led the rest down Meany hill,
'Til he hit a bump and took an awful spill.
He finished at the hut a very poor last,
Staggered to the judges and said with a gasp,
"I stopped on purpose and gave it up,
'Cause I didn't want to win my own darn cup."

Wild Bill Maxwell stopped on purpose,
Wild Bill Maxwell had to give it up,
Wild Bill Maxwell stopped on purpose,
Because he didn't want to win his own darn cup.<sup>[75th][]</sup>

### History
#### 1978

[Fred Ball](/Person/Fred-Ball), an energetic 81-year-old and the 1932 Hut Chairman, entertained the group by singing "Wild Bill Maxwell," a tale written by Art Winder in the 1930's about one of the best-loved and most colorful of Meany's early skiers. Much credit was given to "Max" for organizing the backbreaking labor necessary for building the Hut and clearing the [Lane](/Run/Lane). Maxwell's widow, Opal, proudly beamed in the audience as "Max's" story was told in song.<sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1992

The Mountaineer, November 1992

Service Award to Bill and Judi Maxwell

History reveals that whenever the need is truly greet, those who rise to leader-
ship roles will be truly out-standing. The contributions of Bill and Judi Maxwell demonstrate that the tradition continues. From the mid 1980s through the early 1990s, the Club faced a series of challenges. The most visible of these was the financial management crisis made evident by the need to operate the clubhouse in a way which would satisfy the members' needs and generate sufficient revenue to offset costs. At various times, losses were as high as $10,000 a month! None of the previously tried solutions had sufficient scope to cope with the rapidly changing economy.

Exploring the roots of the Club's financial problems uncovered more fundamental issues involving the role of volunteers in Club operations, and the need to establish effective planning and management practices appropriate to scale of business conducted by the Club. What was needed was a vision of what could be; followed by steady, thoughtful, and consistent leadership applied through the many different groups and activities that are The Mountaineers.

Bill Maxwell instigated the creation of that vision and provided the leadership that made the transition successful. Judi Maxwell also made significant contributions to this transition, working directly at the activities level where concepts are converted into specific actions. The means and the styles each employed were quite different, though equally effective. Bill's high profile enthusiasm and confident manner are obvious to Club members whether they know him personally or not. Judi's enthusiasm and positive attitude are focused on each of the groups she participates in. Both are strong team builders. Both contribute to the effectiveness of the team by sharing their vision and their knowledge, encouraging, others to do the same, and helping the group develop a consensus reflecting the strengths of all.

The Maxwells joined the Club in 1976. Their initial interests led then to the Alpine Scramblers. By the early 1980s, they were heavily involved in the leadership of the Scrambles Committee and its course-related activities. Bill's business knowledge and reputation for teamwork quickly attracted Board attention and he become vice president of the Club in 1985. During his term as president, Bill established the Club's first comprehensive business plan. This plan gave form and substance to his vision for enhanced club business operations which would be more responsive and effective in meeting member needs. Of equal importance were the planning methods Bill introduced. These tools gave the club the means to deal confidently with the challenges of the future. Bill continues to contribute through chairing the Risk Management and Building Planning Committees and participating in the Books Directions Committee.

After serving in a wide range of Scrambles Committee leadership positions and helping with the development of the fifth edition of Freedom of the Hills, Judi was elected to the Board of Trustees in 1989. Her confidence in the role of volunteers as the backbone of Club activities and the soundness of the Club's original purposes has been instrumental in seeking out the most effective ways of implementing change. Recognizing that traditions are particularly important during times of significant change, Judi championed the need to reestablish the Mountaineer Annual, and took on the job of managing editor for the important transitional edition covering the period from 1983 to
1990. She has recently accepted appointment as the 1993 Annual editor.
These two people represent the best traditions of continuing service to The Mountaineers.

For their vision, their examples of effective, complementary leadership, and their continuing commitment to teamwork, The Mountaineers are pleased to present the 1992 Service Award to Bill and Judi Maxwell.

The Service Award recipients were chosen by a board-appointed committee consisting of Delmar Fadden, Chairman, Fran Troje and Sam Fry.


#### 1998

Slalom and downhill races for men began that same year, with trophies donated by [Bob Hayes](/Person/Robert-Hayes) and Bill Maxwell. Maxwell, with a nickname of "Wild Bill" earned in part by his skiing technique, competed in the first race for the trophy he sponsored-and came in dead last. <sup>[Life At Meany][life]</sup>
