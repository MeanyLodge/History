### The Mountaineer, 1956

#### A Word Portrait of Edmond S. Meany

by LYDIA LOVERING FORSYTH

FROM 1908 UNTIL 1935, Edmond Stephen Meany was president of The Mountaineers.
Though we felt that he was ours exclusively, we had to share him with the University of Washington where he was a favorite professor, "ideal alumnus" and the acknowledged keeper of the traditions of that great institution.

We in the club never thought of our membership simply as a convenience for taking part in its activities. To us it was a privilege and treasured as such. This was due to the type of man who was our leader.

This sketch will attempt to reveal to members who never knew him the exceptional personality of Dr. Meany. We hope, too, to those who knew him and were his Mountaineer companions, it may recall happy memories of their association with him.

Too great a task for any one person! So through telephone calls, personal chats and written replies from old-timers to a plea for some treasured memory, this delineation has been woven. Though few quotation marks have been used, the entire account could well be enclosed in "quotes."

President Meany was tall and trim of figure and carried his red head proudly. On the trail he wore a corduroy suit, high boots and wide-brimmed ranger style felt hat. At campfires he stood erect; the straight trees behind him; the light of the fire upon him-a symbol of the best in mountaineering.

Though he seemed sparely built he was a man of magnificent physique, having the muscles of a blacksmith, reports one Mountaineer who at Hannegan Pass rejoiced with him under a waterfall. Professor Meany stood like a rock taking the full force of the downpour upon his shoulders and his shouts of joy awakened the echoes.

His friendliness! A volume could be written upon that. It was so utterly sincere and natural, as this incident will reveal. A rather austere climber making her first Mountaineer trip reached the station early. As she sat alone, a tall handsome red-headed stranger came up to her and said, "I see you are one of us." From that moment she felt and knew that she was. Recalling his friendliness later she said, "I can see why you all love him.'

The first thing that one newcomer noted when coming into the club was the atmosphere of camaraderie mingled with deference in our association with Professor Meany. As one old-timer expressed it:

"I was about 20-a kid you might say. I just went along on the local walks; called everyone else by the first name but not Professor Meany. He was very human and likable - everyone liked him. He was helpful but no taskmaster. I liked the way he conducted a meeting. To make a point he would drop in the telling of some incident, carrying on til he felt you had the point and then "chop it off" with a chuckle. When I went into service in the first World War, I felt I wouldn't need my membership so dropped it. A while after my return, Professor Meany wrote me a letter asking me to rejoin. I felt if it seemed that important to him, it meant a lot to me to be a member. That was perhaps a small matter; but the things he did touched us. We appreciated his guidance.
He was a man of compassion."

He was indeed. Walking along his paper route one night was a discouraged little boy.
Collections had been difficult; his was an attitude of complete discouragement. Just then he was met by such a friendly stranger who at a glance had sensed the youngsters dejection and so stopped for a chat with him. The boy was so deeply impressed that he raced home to tell of it and from his description of the man his father said, "That must have been Professor Meany." Yes, Professor Meany who when himself a stripling had earned his way through school delivering the morning paper.

He was a man who enjoyed the limelight and yet was unusually shy and withdrawn. His was a benign and brooding presence, lending dignity to any occasion at which he presided whether a general meeting, a banquet or a campfire. He was always gracious and infallibly kind.

Professor Meany stood out as a Christian. He was full of fun and had a fine sense of humor, but his duty to his Maker stood above all.

His ready wit was such that he could even joke about real torment as when at Garibaldi he remarked that the only way to have more mosquitoes would be to make 'em smaller.
