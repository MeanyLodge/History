### History
#### 1981

On the light side, Al Alleman and Kent Nelson, amid great applause, were awarded the "Order of the Mole - Second Class" for excavating the three foot diameter by thirty foot long culvert of Weasel Creek which had collected debris for over four years. These two were told that if they wish to try for the Order of the Mole - First Class" they would have to dig a longer hole.<sup>[hr][]</sup>

Partial list of Al Alleman's Meany Contributions

by [Idona Kellogg](/Person/Idona-Kellogg)

Developed and maintained cross country ski trails. He laid out a number of cross country routes including Al's Trail and Nikki's Trail. He led crews to clear and maintain these trails. He helped build bridges needed for some of these trails.

In the winter time he made sure these cross country ski trails were useable. (Some of the Meany folks remember Al laboriously covering up foot prints made in some cross country trails by folks not so familiar with the needs of cross country skiers.)

For years Al led one or two cross country ski trips out of Meany every weekend. Over the years he has taken many, many Mountaineers and guests to the weather station, microwave tower, etc.

Al can be considered a 'Goodwill Ambassador for the Mountaineers because of all the people he has tried to assist. This aid applies not only to his helping people enjoy the terrain around Meany but also to his friendliness in the lodge. He tried to make people feel at home and welcome. He was very encouraging. He had a great sense of humor that helped relax people.

Al was active in Meany folkdances too. He enjoyed folk dancing and tried to get others out on the dance floor. This was another way Al helped people have a good time at Meany.

Al was always ready to help with the Meany chores. He would do whatever jobs needed to be done from emptying the garbage to swabbing floors. Some Meany folks remember how Al took upon himself the task of keeping the fires going. He would drink an extra cup of colfee at night so he would have to 'get up in the night" and then would put a log on the fire while he was up.

One Meany story tells how Al carried a toilet from the road to the hut on skis, "This was the first 'porta potty'."

Al donated a microwave for the Meany Kitchen.

Al helped with projects to maintain and repair the main road to Meany. He dug out weasel creek culvert when it was clogged. He helped keep Two-Pipe Creek culvert clear of debris so that it wouldn't wash out the Meany road as it had done twice before.

He donned hip boots and scuba diver gloves to fasten chains on boulders in stampede creek when crew was rebuilding log bridge which had washed out. The water was icy cold but Al worked in the water with a winch line to help install the new footings and reinforcements.

Al installed erosion control barriers on fjord thru Stampede Creek. Again this made the road to Meany drivable and helped restore the creek.

Al helped erect and maintain the ski tow poles.

Although Al was a professional plumber by trade his many talents where appreciated in all the projects he contributed to. Al installed and maintained the plumbing at Meany. This often required that he work under the lodge. He "squirmed around like a snake in limited space to plumb the sinks for the kitchen.

Many Meanyites remember Al's attempts to teach conservation of materials. He advocated only one paper towel was needed for drying. He wanted things recycled and hated to see food wasted.


#### 2020

One Sunday morning Al took me up to the Mt. Francis microwave towers and I skied down the clear cuts by myself coming out about 2 gullies beyond Walt's Woods. Don't know if I'd have the nerve to do that now but when you're young and invulnerable, early 40's or so. Also had memories of Al Alleman working the #2 rope at Stevens Pass in the mid/late 50's. --[Norm Vigus](/Person/Norm-Vigus)
