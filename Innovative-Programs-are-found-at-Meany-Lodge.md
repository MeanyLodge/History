# Innovative Programs are found at Meany Lodge

By Patti Polinsky, PSIA-NW Certified Instructor, 2003

Since Edmond Meany purchased a parcel of land, one day's travel by cross- country skis from the Mountaineers Lodge at Lodge Lake near Snoqualmie Summit, Meany Lodge Sports Center has been a unique institution.

In the early years Meany Lodge served as a home for snowshoeing and cross-
country skiing. Later, when a rope tow was built, lift assisted downhill skiing was possible at Meany.

Downhill skiing seminars were added in the early 70's so more people could learn and enjoy the pearl no public ski area could offer, a whole weekend of skiing in untracked snow. These seminars developed into scheduled classes for all levels of downhill skiing. These classes presented a problem; there was no area or lift for beginner skiers, especially small children, to learn to ski.
A beginner tow, called the [Turtle tow](/Turtle), was constructed in an area not accessed by advanced or fast skiers but yet within a few feet of the observation tower. The slope was graded to be just steep enough to allow one to slide but never develop any speed. The area was quickly utilized not only by small children, but by adults learning to ski and by cross-country skiers wanting to learn how to turn.

As Meany Lodge continued to develop, faithful volunteers strove to have the Lodge be the center of many activities of The Mountaineer Club the year around.
Concentrated [MOFA](/Event/MOFA) (Mountaineer Oriented First Aid) courses were offered. Meany Lodge, located in the woods with steep slopes, marshlands, trees and brush, made planned practice accidents very real. The [MOFA](/Event/MOFA) Committee has continued to offer several courses a year at Meany.

In the fall, mushrooms abound at Meany. This delicacy could not be wasted. Meany Lodge invited the Naturalists of the Mountaineers and the Puget Sound Mycological Society to join together to enjoy a weekend hunting for, finding, identifying and finally eating gourmet meals featuring mushrooms. This has grown to also include a craft section of use of mushrooms, a preparation and cooking seminar, and an evening lecture with spectacular slides.

Winter activities continued to expand. Besides the downhill ski courses the Meany Winter Sports School (accredited by the Snow Sports Association) added classes and seminars in ski skating, cross-country skiing, telemark skiing and the new snow sport claimed initially by teenagers, snowboarding. It seemed prudent to set cross-country tracks on Meany's property so a commercial track setter was purchased and a series of trails were created. The track setter also groomed and set with track the 2.5 miles from the parking lot to the base of Meany Lodge hill. Now beginners could cross-country ski almost the complete distance into the lodge on relatively level trail. Cross-country skiing to the Lodge became not only exercise but a social trip in lovely terrain.

With Meany Lodge located in the heart of the Snoqualmie Pin Peaks a weekend of summertime hiking from the lodge evolved to a Mountaineers Family Hike and Kite
Flying weekend. This year hikes featuring many of the 20 Snoqualmie Pin Peaks are being sponsored by various branch groups along with hikes lead by Meany volunteers. Even though the wind is erratic at Meany Lodge, everyone has fun flying kites which they have made and decorated.

Year around use of Meany Lodge Sports Center by Mountaineers and their activities is becoming a reality because volunteers have made it happen. Meany Lodge continues to attract Mountaineers enjoying the camaraderie and fellowship of other Mountaineers who are willing to lend a hand to develop this pearl in the woods.

In the future Meany hopes to continue to improve the lodge to fulfill the needs of the membership. The purchase and installation of a used chairlift would allow everyone access to the top of the hill in wintertime and could be used in summertime to take mountain bikers and sightseers up the hill for easy access to beautiful mountain countryside.<sup>[75th][]</sup>
