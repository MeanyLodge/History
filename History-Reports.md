Matt's Note: The reports thru 1983 are included in the [Mountaineer Annuals](Mountaineer-Annual). Some reports overlap with [History-Walt](History-Walt).

## 1978

It all began at Meany this season with preparation for its 50th Birthday Party, Sept. 23-24. This turned out to be an exceptionally well-organized spectacular event with 450 participants.

A highlight of the ski season was the [carnival](Carnival) weekend which featured many corny contests and crazy races, a clowns contest and a "European Feast" complete with German hot potato salad and homemade European pastries, pretzels and breadsticks. Many fancy relish trays with elaborate flowered vegetable "nibbles" and apple swans served from an outdoor snow table is an example of how embellished and painstaking the carnival events were. This fantastic weekend was masterminded by [Patti Polinsky](Patti-Polinsky).

One extra special Saturday night program was the dedication banquet for "Walt's Woods" with Master of Ceremonies Lee Heiser cleverly spicing the evening and a film on Walter shown by [Bob Bentler](Bob-Bentler). A huge cake shaped like a bald head contained a hidden cavity which was opened to reveal Walter's thoughts in the form of sayings on heart-shaped candies.

A very important change to the Meany vicinity was made in the summer when the US Forest service logged Section 34, which included "Henrietta's Woods" and "No-Name-Woods." These areas are now known as "Henrietta's Meadow and "Walter's Woods." The gulley between the two has been christened "RBCSA (Retroactive Birth Control Society of America) GULCH" and the cross-country ski trail labeled "Al's Fringe".

In September, a gigantic Wolf gas kitchen range with two large ovens was somehow hauled into Meany's kitchen.

## 1979

For the first time ever a marriage took place at Meany as Georgean and Dick Curran skied to their wedding at the top of "Kitchen Run". Following the ceremony the minister skied the hill with the rest of the wedding party. A huge seven-part cake made by Idona Kellogg was brought in sections and assembled at the lodge. The reception began with a march of the newly-weds through arched ski-poles.

Record crowds were drawn this season by outstanding live music, vigorous folk dancing, home-made ice cream parties, fantastic skiing, terrific ski lessons by [Patti Polinsky](Patti-Polinsky), [Dave Claar](Dave-Claar) and Glen Polinsky, entertaining plays and programs, and world encompassing movies and slide shows.

Special thanks go to musicians Richard Swensson, [Art Nation](Art-Nation), Lyle Schaefer, Frank Gilbert, Jim Noyes, Roy Wagner, Olemara Peters, and the Speldosan Group. Also "The Mountaineer Players" presented three delightful performances: The Story theatre, Who Murdered Who, and a musical review, F.M at P.M. Thanks also to Jack Reid and Michael Clarke who did great jobs with their slide shows of recent trips.

Alaska Weekend went over big with a greased pole contest, a gorp presentation, Alaska slides by Paul Bergman and movies by [Bob Bentler](Bob-Bentler), a reading by Royce Natoli of Robert Stevenson's "Iceworm Cocktail," and refreshments of ice worms and Ghosttown Sourdough Cookies. That's enough to turn anybody into a "blooming bonifide sourdough".

Another notable weekend was the Leap Day Bonanza where Hildegarde Hamhocker of Tumbleweeds (played by [Bob Bentler](Bob-Bentler)) and Sadie Hawkins from Dogpatch (portrayed by [Norm Vigus](Norm-Vigus)) invaded to choose a mate from among the many Meany eligibles. Other skit characters were the minister ([Dave Claar](Dave-Claar)) and the victim (Charlie Vail). Walter B. Little walked away with the Bachelor of the Year Award with Norm Vigus as runner-up. Bob Bentler showed Super 8 movies of Walt and Norm to prove why they should be winners.

The annual [Carnivale di Meany](Carnival) was again a superb event as master-minded by [Patti Polinsky](Patti-Polinsky). In addition to skiing events there were corny contests and crazy races, a clowns contest, and a "European Feast" complete with German hot potato salad and homemade European pastries, pretzels and breadsticks.

Fall work parties installed a second hot water tank, painted the "cats" and started the enormous task of cleaning "Walter's Woods" and "Henrietta's Meadow". In addition to the usual fall maintenance and upkeep. After long negotiations with the railroad, we gained final approval installed a gate below the railroad to help cut down on vandalism



## 1980

Meany started with a strong work party season; in other words, there was a packed lodge each weekend and abundant willing workers. The ski season looked promising as there appeared to be a zooming interest shown by many newcomers and old-timers alike. All expectations were washed away by rain and lack of snow. However, the few weekends Meany did open the skiing was superb.

The work party season was very productive. A tool shed was built to house tractor (snow-cats) parts. The study area was moved from the end of the Third Person's Dorm to a small area taken off of the Woman's Dorm. Bunks were added to formed study room so that Meany's sleeping capacity remains the same.

New tracks were put on TomCat and many modifications were made to Pack Rat. It was stripped and repainted; new shift linkage was installed; a new instrument panel was fabricated; and a new transmission was added. All of this required much creative adaptation by some brilliant minds.

Concrete steps were poured near the kitchen door and a concrete sidewalk was put in from the front steps to the basement.

Much of the hill was brushed and a new bridge was placed across Tombstone Canyon.



## 1981

Winter 80-81 ski season was washed away by rain, but Meany did manage to open in February and March for a few weekends of skiing on new fallen but sparse snow. The [tow hut](Tow-Hut) logs shows "Mach" tow was operated for only 50 hours in 80-81 ski season. By the time this article was written on Jan 10, 1982, the 81-82 ski season had already used the "Mach" tow for sixty hours.

In August over a hundred Meanyites met at Gasworks Park in Seattle for an potluck and reunion.

Crews built from Puget Sound Power brought a power line across "Lower Slobbovia" to the lodge. This became necessary because last year a tree took out a power line and during the process of repair BNRR management discovered that Meany was still getting power from the railroad. The power permit was canceled, but BNRR continued to supply power during spring-summer 81, until the new power connection was established. Thank you BNRR and thanks to Carsten Lien for negotiating this arrangement.

Also during the fall, the "in-house" telephone system was restored. Bell Telephone connections were repaired too. the shed to house tractor (Sno-cat) parts was completed. Some of the poles for "Mach" and "Worm" tows were replaced. The bridge over Stampede Creek was rebuilt where an abutment had washed out. The culvert at Weasel Creek was cleaned out so it is no longer necessary to cover it with a log bridge which always had to be removed after the snow melted.

On the light side, Al Alleman and Kent Nelson, amid great applause, were awarded the "Order of the Mole - Second Class" for excavating the three foot diameter by thirty foot long culvert of Weasel Creek which had collected debris for over four years. These two were told that if they wish to try for the Order of the Mole - First Class" they would have to dig a longer hole.

Work party goers were treated to lively evenings at the lodge with lots of folk dancing, A Halloween party, a steak feed, and ski movies

From Christmas to New Year's, Meany was well attended and blessed with absolutely super snow. Although the entire week was filled with activities both on the hill and in the lodge, the New Year's Eve festivities were notable. It all started when the "Advanced Emissary of the New Year's Baby," Walter B. Little appeared. This messenger introduced the New Year with a "make-it-yourself" Pizza party and a magnificent Torchlight Parade. Creative and unusual pizzas emerged quickly from the dozens of "pizza fixins" furnished, but the spectacular Torchlight Parade stole the show. Brian Johnson organized this remarkable serpentine of twenty torchbearers and assembled them at the top of the ski hill at 11:55 pm. Slowly the group wound their way to the bottom of the hill and planted the torches in a figure "2" near the bonfire. There amidst jubilation and singing, the new year arrived. All who wished, skied the lighted hill from 11 pm to 12:30 am.

Also during the Christmas week, an Indiana man, Tom McCart, won the "Uno Championship". This Great Northwest visitor also came the longest distance: over 2000 miles.

## 1982

Record crowds were drawn to Meany this season by plentiful snow, fantastic skiing, terrific ski lessons with capacity classes taught by [Patti Polinsky](Patti-Polinsky), [Dave Claar](Dave-Claar) and Kim Nelson, vigorous folk dancing, extremely talented musicians and entertaining skits and programs.

One of the biggest thrills was Dick Curran's 50 ft aerial ride which was the last leg of an obstacle course he set up for the [Carnivale di Meany](Carnival). The Spring Carnival has an Austrian flavor as Patti Polinsky masterminded "zillertal" activities. This enormous undertaking included a hill-wide scavenger hunt, snow golfing, bow and arrow rivalry, a been carry, slow slalom course, Frisbee toss, snake follow, inner-tube run, kids "costume" parade, an authentic Austrian dinner, a huge "Konditorei" pastry table, a lavish luncheon completer with fancy vegetable nibbles and homemade breadsticks and pretzels and a "lively" folk dance stimulated by Meany's gifted Musicians.

The proportion of cross-country skiers using Meany Lodge continues to increase. Al Alleman graciously donates the time and expertise to show people the fabulous ski trails in Meany vicinity. During work party season Al's crew labors to improve these trails.

During work party season, Meany women took charge of the "Ox" and the two hill "brush" saws. Thanks to the gals, the whole lane, from top to bottom, had been brushed. This took two year to do but it is now skiable on six inches of snow! The ladies on the "Ox" lifted and hauled firewood, propane tanks, giant pumpkins, dozens of mattresses, Cat ski boxes, tractor treads, brush, garbage, you name it. Meanwhile, Meany men overhauled both tractors (Sno-cats).

The new mattresses were hauled in and mattress covers sewn. The study was paneled. [Ray Nelson](Ray-Nelson) made two wooden couches and a bench for Meany's basement. the entire basement was remodeled adding several new drying areas and a first aid facility. Tom-Cat was refurbished with new paint, new canvas, new upholstery, and gorgeous Scandinavian designs on the ski boxes. In addition to "flowering" the ski boxes, Georgean Curran "rosemaled" the picture boards for Meany walls.

A cross-country ski bridge was built built by the railroad tunnel. The Cat road to the lodge was straightened. A Gas House was added to the [Tow Hut](Tow-Hut). A new communications system was initiated. The Generator Hut received some carpentry. The pantry was rigged with wire mesh. Logs were winched off North. The trail from "Walter's Woods" to "North" was regraded. The bridge at the bottom of Tombstone canyon was improved.

Remote Meany Ski Hut boasts a bountiful winter 1987. With a very active PR Committee led by Norm Vigus. The lodge attracted an average of 75 per weekend. Ski School lessons kept the lodge filled on the weekends with poor snow conditions.

Video pictures of the ski classes were tried for the first time in February with whooping success. By November a video camera was purchased to be used with Meany's Ski School. The VCR and color TV were donated.

Cross-country ski lessons were started. Telemark turn practice on the became popular as did use of Meany's six major cross-country loop trails. A "Kamikaze Challenge Ski Race" and a "Ski School Cross Country Race" added excitement to the growing sport.

For downhill skiers, a new Beginners Ski Area was developed with a grade of seven degrees or less (the Turtle tow) and long, safe runouts. The old Worm Tow was relocated to this area. A new rope tow (super worm) donated to Meany by Crystal Mountain Ski Area was assembled on the lower Lane . A drive system was engineered and fabricated for this intermediate tow. Adjustable wheels placed on "Mach Tow" appears to have eliminated the problem of rope twisting. An extension boom was built on Ox to lift machinery for all the tow work
