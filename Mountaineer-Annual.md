The Past Ski Year

by Andrew Anderson

p. 19

And finally, for the benefit of the lazy and not-too-proud-to-ride, investigations have been made concerning the possibility of installing a rope "ski tow" up the lane at Martin. Ski tows have been used in the East for several years and are being installed in numbers this winter. Such a device on the lane or, possibly, the rock slide at Snoqualmie Lodge would take much of the effort out of our skiing and rapidly improve our technique because of the opportunity for abundant practice and downhill running.

MEANY SKI HUT was favored with excellent snow conditions throughout most of the season, enabling competitive events to be run off in good order. Attendance showed a favorable gain over past seasons both with Club members and outside groups. A small water power lighting plant was developed by Willard Johnston and Jack Hossack, Hut chairman, new decorations provided by others and several interior improvements made, all of which contributed considerably to the appearance and comfort of the Hut. Consistently good ski conditions, the fun of Hut parties, the tasty meals, the fine support of the membership, and the unfailing service of committee members combined to make a successful season.

ACTIVITIES

With the approach of winter, of course skiing comes to the foreground. Bruce Steere of Seattle, and C. Gordon Uran of Everett, did everything in their power to enable the skiers to enjoy themselves, including the showing of numerous instructive and interesting ski pictures, sponsoring an illustrated talk by Arnold Lunn, and conducting public ski classes for beginners.

The Club decided to abandon outside ski competition with the exception of retention of membership in Pacific Northwest Ski Association and continuance of the Open Patrol Race. The Ski Committee is authorized to employ a ski instructor for the coming season, his time to be divided between Snoqualmie Lodge and Meany Ski Hut, providing enough interest is shown.

The skiers showed great progress in technique and skill.

MEANY SKI HUT, the complement of skiing, has shown an increase in attendance due to the tireless efforts of Fred Gibbons and his committee, in making everyone feel at home and in clearing lanes for better runs. A ski lift is to be realized before the coming season opens. Too much praise cannot be given to members of Fred's frequent work parties.

An appropriation of one thousand dollars to construct an addition to the east end of Meany Ski Hut was made.

p. 18

Work! This has been almost the sole thought associated with Meany Ski Hut for the past two seasons. Last summer it was work on the ski lift and the 15x20-foot log cabin necessary to house the tractor. This summer it has been work, a total of 350 working weekends to build the fine three-story, 24x30 foot addition to the hut itself. The lift is 835' feet long and rises 310 feet in less than two minutes. It is so constructed that a skier may get off at any level. The hut has a large basement housing a furnace, drying room, waxing room and wash rooms. The large recreation room on the first floor will see many an oldtime dance which will help to dim the memory of aching muscles and smashed fingers acquired during the construction. The club has been extremely fortunate in having among its members construction engineers, pattern makers, mechanics and other skilled laborers, so that both constructions have been accomplished entirely with volunteer labor. Now the work is over and fun will be the word for Meany. Building Committee: [Jack Hossack](Jack-Hossack), [Walter Little](Walter-Little), T. Davis Castor, Calvin Jones, Phyllis Cavender, and Mary Kelley.

EVENTS OF THE SKI YEAR

by WALTER HOFFMAN

The Ski Committee carried out the original set of Club races. For the first event coming on January 28th, the Book Store Cross Country Women's and Men's Races were held. The course was laid out on the old railroad grade above Meany Ski Hut. There were five participants. On February 4th the annual race with the Sahalie Club on Sahalie Hill was held in a snow storm. The results were close. On February 18th the Mountaineers participated in the Snoqualmie Four Way Meet and came in second place in the team totals. The women took two firsts. On February 24th-25th the novice Harper Cup Races and Jumps were to be run off but due to bad weather only the jumps were held. Art Wilson won. Four jumpers participated. March 2nd,3rd, the annual Open Patrol Race was held with five teams entering. Weather and snow were very good. The Washington Alpine Club team placed first. On March 10th the Maxwell, Walsh, and Hayes Trophy Races were held at Meany Ski Hut. The new idea of a "Cookie Race" was started.
The Mountaineer team entered in most of the P.N.S.A. meets around the state. Elov Bodin, Wayne Swift and Scott Edson made very good show, ings among the best skiers in the Northwest.

The Committee outlined a trail marking program with the Sahalie and Washington Alpine Clubs for the coming year. Silver Ski Trips were recorded and trips scheduled from Meany Ski Hut and Snoqualmie Lodge.

MEANY SKI HUT

by [Walter Little](Walter-Little).

After completion of the new addition to Meany Ski Hut last fall, hopes were high for an unusually fine skiing season, whereupon the weatherman served up the worst snow in the history of the hut. Eight inches of snow at New Year's; twenty-four inches of snow in the middle of January; forty inches maximum depth for the season, so ran the dismal events. But it takes more than a little bad weather to dim the skiers' enthusiasm, and so there was better than average attendance and more than average fun. The ski lift hoisted capacity crowds up the hill every weekend as soon as the snow was deep enough, and the ski instruction was well patronized and aided in increasing the general level of skiing ability.

Work parties this summer concentrated on smoothing up the "lane." All stumps and logs were removed from a large area next to the ski lift, and the ground smoothed so that skiing will be possible on a foot of snow, in case the snow season is as bad as last year, which heaven forbid! The worst pileups of logs were flattened out on the remainder of the "lane" so there will be fewer bumps and a smoother hill this next winter. Finally a ski jump was constructed, the whole lane brushed off and a new and flatter zig-zag trail constructed on the north side of the "lane," for the benefit of all those who do not like to "take 'er straight."

With new lift rope, gasoline, coal and supplies all ready, only snow is needed to start another fine season at the Meany Ski Hut.

### Mountaineering on Skis
[Walter Little](Walter-Little)

SKIS are the best instrument yet developed by man for foot travel across snow fields. When a man puts on skis and slides down hill he is a skier; when he uses those skis to travel about near timberline or below he is a ski tourer in the common sense of the word; when he uses those skis to ascend high peaks, glaciers or areas above timberline, he becomes a ski-mountaineer. Practically, however, the moment that a skier leaves the highway or a populated skiing center he becomes a ski-mountaineer, for his enjoyment of his trip and even his survival may be dependent on knowledge of the mountains not required by the skier who stays on the hill. For the purpose of this article, let us say that ski-mountaineering is that branch of the sport involved in all ski trips away from the practice hill; ski-touring is a specialized part of ski-mountaineering confined to trips adjacent to or below timberline; high-level ski-mountaineering is done on the high areas above timberline and on the glaciers.

Skiing-and probably ski-mountaineering-has been known for centuries by the central Asian tribes and the Scandinavians, who used it in a utilitarian way. Ski-mountaineering, in the modern sense of a recreational sport can be said to have begun when Wilhelm Paulcke and four companions traversed the Bernese Oberland of the Swiss Alps in January, 1897, about forty-five years ago. To gain perspective on the magnitude of this expedition, consider that the party was out for five days in the middle of winter, crossed two passes with altitudes in excess of 10,500 feet, made an attempt to climb the Jungfrau, being stopped by bad weather at 12,600 feet, and crossed five major glaciers. Consider that this was the first trip of any kind of this nature-although skis had been known in the Alps since about 1880-and that Paulcke and his friends had no benefit of modern equipment, no ski boots, no ski wax, no sealskins, and no skiing technique except kickturns, and you will get a sense of the greatness of the achievement, which even today ranks as a first class trip. What made it possible, of course, was that Paulcke and his friends were primarily mountaineers. They had learned enough about the mountains from foot-climbing to enable them to readily adapt the new tool-skis to mountaineering uses.

What Paulcke started was picked up and carried on with enthusiasm by all varieties of skiers-Swiss, Germans, Austrians, English, French and Italians-until by 1926 all of the major peaks in the Alps had been climbed either wholly or in part on skis. These efforts were greatly aided by the settled condition of the Alps where access was possible from many railheads, every mountain valley had its little town with available food and shelter and nearly every peak was furnished with an alpine club hut. Contrast the local situation. In 1926 Snoqualmie Pass had not yet been opened for winter traffic and it was still five years before the winter road was opened to Paradise Valley. Almost all that is known of ski-mountaineering in the modern recreational sense was, of course, developed in the Alps during this period.
Terrain is the first requirement. On this continent we have it in abundance, much of the best of it as yet inaccessible for winter use. Only a very little was available until about ten years ago. It is not surprising that ski-mountaineering is relatively undeveloped. Possibly the best potential country is in the Canadian Rockies, still practically inaccessible, and in the Canadian Coast Range near Mount V/addington, which has been penetrated once on skis by a party from England, of all places!

p. 6

Excellent skiing and mountaineering are now accessible in the American Rockies and in the Sierra Nevadas, both of which only recently have been opened up. The Pacific Northwest is probably the best of all potential ski-mountaineering country in the United States, providing a very long snow season lasting at higher altitudes from November to July, fine peaks and the only possibility for glacier skiing.

Skiing development here, as it seems to do in most new areas, has centered attention on skiing competition for the better 10% and practice hill sliding for the other 90%. But concurrently there were a few scattered exploits in ski-mountaineering, some of which will be related here.

Apparently the first local skiing ever known in this area was done by Norm Engle and Thor Bisgaard of the Mountaineers in 1914 at Paradise Valley. Thor Bisgaard was a Norwegian consul and had known skiing in Norway. What they started was soon taken up by the Mountaineers, who, beginning in 1916, put on annual winter outings to Paradise Valley until 1930. In the early days just getting up to Paradise Valley was a real exploit, since one had to walk, ski, or snowshoe the whole twenty miles in from Ashford. Very few had skis, and some of those who did snowshoed in with their skis on their back.

Subsequent skiing history in this area is unknown to this writer up to about 1927, but it is evident that developments were slowly taking place, because in 1927 and 1928 what were apparently the first attempts to scale Mount Rainier on skis were made by three parties of Mountaineer members. Remember, it was not until four years later that the winter road to Paradise was first opened. Regular skiing in this area was unknown.

The route selected for the attempted ascent was from Starbo Camp in Glacier Basin on the Northeast side of the mountain up to Steamboat Prow via the Inter Glacier, thence up the Emmons Glacier to the summit. Access to Starbo Camp was one of the difficult parts. At that time the road over Chinook Pass was still under construction and it was necessary to ski in all the way from Silver Springs to Starbo, a distance of sixteen miles. Down trees across the old mining road that led to Starbo did not help matters much.

So, in April, 1927, [Bill Maxwell](Bill-Maxwell), Andy Anderson, Fred DuPuis and Lang Slaussen went to bed at Starbo with a blizzard raging outside, and awoke in the morning to find clear weather and six inches of new powder snow. Even though getting under way as soon as possible and traveling fast, they found when they reached Camp Curtis at elevation 9500 that they would not have time enough to make the ascent and regretfully turned back. Disappointment was slightly allayed by a glorious run down the Inter Glacier.

They were back again, with some changes in the party, on May 2. Bill Maxwell, Andy Anderson, and Lester LaVeile left Starbo Camp very early, had good snow and weather conditions, and were well on their way to the summit, when at 12,800 feet just below the saddle between Liberty Cap and Columbia Crest, they were met by a violent wind, which effectively prevented further progress on skis. So they turned back down the Emmons Glacier and again had fine skiing all the way to Starbo Camp. The rope was discarded half way down the Emmons Glacier as an impediment to proper skiing and an unjustified burden to humanity.

Back they came again in April, 1928, this time a party of seven, Bill Maxwell, Andy Anderson, Fred DuPuis, Lars Novseth, Walter Best, Otto Strizek, and Otto Giese. Up to Steamboat Prow the snow was good, above that point became progressively worse as the effects of wind drifting became more and more noticeable. Skis were finally abandoned at about 11,800 feet, but three of the party, Otto Strizek, Otto Giese, and Walter Best continued on to the summit with the aid of crampons to complete the second winter ascent of the peak.

p. 7

First ski ascent of the peak was made by the late Sigurd Hall on July 2, 1939, who joined forces with Andy Hennig, now a ski instructor at Sun Valley, Idaho. Both were members of the Mountaineers. This time they could drive to a point only four miles from Starbo Basin, quite a pleasant change from the tribulations suffered by their predecessors. They proceeded up to Steamboat Prow on the first day, camped there the first night, and were joined by a climbing party led by Larry Pemberthy. When they arose at 3:00 a.m. next morning weather conditions were not too good, there being a light cloud overcast and a cold wind. Up to 11,000 feet climbing conditions were not too bad, although there were many rain troughs running down the glacier. At this point, Andy Hennig had trouble with his bindings, and substituted crampons, leaving Sig Hall as the only skier. Above this point the mountain was solidly sheathed in ice, nice for crampon climbing, but tough on skis. Even so, Sig persevered, even though at times he had to stamp his steel edges two or three times into the icy crust in order to get any footing, and the strain on his ankles was terrific. However, Sig on skis and Andy on foot arrived at the crater, and the mountain had finally been conquered on skis-that is, the upward trip. Conditions were impossible for downward skiing, however, so that Hall had to don his crampons and carry his skis down to elevation 12,000 where the snow finally softened enough to permit skiing, but the visibility was by this time practically zero, because of the gathering storm, and it was necessary to run the rest of the way to Steamboat Prow in long, slow traverses. Below this point and in spite of the pouring rain, they had a good run down the Inter Glacier.

It is apparent that the feasibility of a ski ascent and descent of Mount Rainier has not yet been proved for, in spite of Sig Hall's magnificent feat, the conditions were essentially unsuitable for skiing. It is also apparent that the real reason for skiing up a mountain is to make it possible to ski down! Carrying skis downhill would not encourage many to take up the sport!

Sigurd Hall did not confine his efforts to Mount Rainier but rode his skis up to and down from the summits of Adams, Baker, St. Helens and Glacier, as well as numerous other peaks, accompanied at various times by Dwight Watson, Walt Hoffman, John James and others.

### THE SKI COMMITTEE
by Phyllis Cavender

And we must not forget "cookie slaloms"-our very special weekly ski event at Meany Ski Hut. An easy slalom course was set up and we skied not against each other but against a standard time set for the course, and this was real fun.

We played host to the Washington Alpine Club at Meany Ski Hut and the enjoyable time we had in engaging them in friendly competition we hope to duplicate again and again in the coming years.

The Mountaineer ski school conducted on the Meany Ski Hill was highly successful under the tutelage of Al Lubberts. The attendance in classes was limited to ten in number and many times the day was not long enough to provide instruction for all the applicants.

May our future seasons prove as much fun as this one!

### MEANY SKI HUT
by [Joe Buswell](Joe-Buswell)

The season started with the usual hilarious New Year's Party, and though there was a serious lack of snow everyone seemed to have a fine time. After two years of unusual snowfall it should get back to normal this year. (That is what we said last year.)

The Ski Committee initiated the highly successful Cookie Slalom, a race  which wins a cookie for those racers expert enough to negotiate the course within a certain time limit.

An extra special event was a get-together with the Washington Alpine Club which resulted in a full house and fun for all, with a party Saturday night and an informal ski meet on Sunday.

The old ski tow rope lasted the season and is even now waiting to start its fourth year. New coils were installed in the generator and a new axle was provided for the tractor which we hope will result in a trouble-free season for the coming year.

In spite of the lack of snow, more than normal attendance was had for the brief season which ended with the Open Patrol Race on March 9.

Three work parties this fall (average attendance, fifty) have widened and smoothed "Kirkland Park" until good skiing is now guaranteed with one foot of snow. Also, the kitchen has had its face lifted and painted-and how!

Everything is ready for the coming season and if all of you will pray to Saint Peter for some snow it will be perfect.

MEANY SKI HUT: After many months of hoping by Chairman [Joe Buswell](Joe-Buswell), there was finally enough snow at Meany to satisfy the most ardent ski enthusiasts. Four work parties really barbered the lane; the old ski-tow rope remains in good condition and so if train transportation is available we will be looking forward to another "super" New Year's party.

ACTIVITIES

Meany Ski Hut enjoyed a very successful season. due in part to the unusually heavy snowfall (ten feet were recorded), and to the fact that members could be transported by train during a period of gas rationing. Six work parties during the summer were well attended. Many cords of wood were cut and the tow tractor was given a thorough overhaul. Most important of all, 300 feet were added to the length of the tow, making it 1,100 feet long with a vertical lift of 300 feet. Chairman Kenneth Maclean assures us with pride that the Hut is in excellent shape for heavy post-war use.

THE SKI COMMITTEE, with Jim Wasson as chairman, sponsored the annual Ski Mountaineering Course which was well attended, and culminated by a graduation party at Meany Ski Hut in October. Milt Scarlatos won the Meany Slalom Race and Chuck Welch the Downhill Race. Gordon Butterfield was awarded a cup at the Annual Banquet for outstanding performance among the juniors, and a definite program for the encouragement of Junior Racing is being formulated. Ski Touring was limited by the transportation situation, but trips to Crystal Basin, Granite Mountain, and Silver Peak Basin were scheduled.

Winter was welcomed by all ski happy Mountaineers who voted Meany Ski Hut as much fun as ever, in spite of the late snowfall. Though transportation was limited, each weekend found an eager lineup at the ski tow which now runs to the very top of the lane, while the more adventurous explored cross country as far as the summit of Baldy Mountain. Remembering how much the evenings were enjoyed after a day of skiing, plenty of hands were willing to fill the coal bin and pile the wood high for the coming winter during the four work parties this summer.

Highlights of skiing this year included a gay Mardi Gras and obstacle race as well as the annual club competition. Ann Cederquist and Elov Bodin won the women's and men's slaloms, Helmy Beckey took the down hill, while Bob Winder was awarded the cup for junior high-point man. The Mountaineers four-girl team won the Snoqualmie Club's meet for the second consecutive time.

The ski committee headed by Dave Lind held a successful Ski Mountaineering Course, from which five graduated. Four good ski tours were arranged, as well as a roped skiing practice on Nisqually Glacier. The initiation was held at Meany Ski Hut's October work party. Several special meetings were held during the year, and all skiers showed their versatility by turning out for the ice-skating parties.

Meany Ski Hut
BY Jo Ann Norling

The gods of winter favored Meany highly this year for the Lane lay under snow from November to April. Inter-club races were held successfully on two weekends, testing officially the new downhill course. Most of the Mountaineers who had been in service were skiing once more and proclaimed the Hut just as they remembered it, only better.

We brag that the coming year will be even more so if the amount done on work parties is any criterion. By the time the first snowflake falls on the Lane, Meany will boast a new light plant and new record player, a larger drying room, and (attention, Nashie!) a new stove in a freshly painted peasant kitchen. A complete redesigning of the tow promises to make maintenance much easier during next season.

So wax your skis and put on your favorite schottisch record to enjoy winter 1947 at Meany!

The Lodgers' Tale
by Ken Prestrud

From December through March, fifty to one hundred people took to the hills at Meany Ski Hut each weekend. An instructor was on hand to see that beginners learned the ABC's of skiing. A ski tow, declared by most to be the best in the state, and an excellent hill combined with good snow to make the Meany skiers a proficient crowd. Besides skiing, the happy throng made the hut vibrate to rousing dances, played ping pong and bridge, or just talked.

Meany Ski Lodge Work Parties
By Jo Anne Norling

Timber! The saw is pulled out of the cut. An ax lying by the tree is hurriedly picked up. Branches snap off in the big fir's downward path, and the impact is felt beneath your feet. Another section cleared in the new ski lane and enough wood to keep the hut warm for many evenings of schottisches. And when the snow begins to fill in the hollows and bend down the huckleberry, Meany Ski Hut will be ready for another winter. The need for manpower to build Stevens and Snoqualmie Lodges has necessitated small but efficient work parties. Skiers must eat, so the hut is scrubbed, the food situation checked, and the bin is filled with coal for baking Nashie's pies and cinnamon rolls. Skiers must socialize, so the wood is stacked high for 'round the hot air register discussions, and the hambo records dusted off. And, finally, skiers must ski; the lane gets a thorough brushing and a new tow rope is threaded through the shives. No more long rope-splicing sessions!

But to create and build is far more stimulating than maintenance. This winter when the siren announces dinner you can shove off above the top of the tow, follow the ridge into a portion of the downhill course, point your skis down instead of angling back toward the lane, and pull up behind the hut. If you're still in one piece, it's guaranteed you'll be first in chow line. This new trail will be wide enough for a giant slalom course. The electricians have installed new telephone circuits covering both the downhill and slalom courses, taking the guesswork out of race timing. The novice lane to the left of the tow begun last year has been lengthened and widened. You can learn your snowplows without some schussboomer flashing by your ski tips or falling down in front of you.

It waits only for winter to come. Bring your old records, your studying, your dancing shoes. Bring your accordion, your knitting, your sleeping bag. Incidentally, bring your skis. It won't be very long-the nights are frosty and hint of new snow.

In a flurry of wrenched ankles, multiple fractures, and torn ligaments, the elite of the Mountaineer skiers, namely the racers, staggered through another year of ski competition. The term elite is used with the utmost of casualness. These racers are probably elite only in that they have little or no brain, due to numerous "egg-beaters" taken while vainly attempting to schuss Meany Lane. None the less, these bloody but happy warriors emerged from the '48-49 season with more than modest success in their endeavors.

Individual effort saw several Mountaineer racers advance into Class A. Among those daredevils who succeeded were Churning Chuck Welsh, Brave Dave Roberts, Booming Bill Granton, and Battered Bob Kuss. All these competitors placed consistently high in the numerous races that they entered and thus garnered enough points for their advancement. Dave Roberts did exceptionally well in the Stevens Standards, walking off with a couple of seconds and a third. Chuck Welsh also came into his own by placing high in the Golden Pole at Hood, and other races.

Outstanding among the women competitors was Elaine Holmstad who, in just two years of competition has risen into the ranks of top women racers. Elaine won two Stevens Standards last year, and capped a successful year by winning both the Downhill and Slalom Championships in the PNSA Women's Class B Races. Janet Wright did very well in Junior Competition by winning two Stevens Standards. Grace Bovee showed her usual flawless style.

Several races that are shining memories to the competitors should really be mentioned at this point. Of utmost interest, of course, were the Club championships held on Meany Lane in early April. Running under ideal conditions, the Slalom was held in the morning on the Lane with two well known competitors setting and forerunning the course. These noted racer were none other than "Zero" Kastner and Ray MacGowan.

Winning the Slalom took some very fancy skiing on the part of Tattered Ted Whiting, as Bob Kuss was hot on his tail, followed by Dayrell Bate, Bob Power, and sixteen other competitors.

Ladies' winner was Jo Anne Norling Feringer, hotly pursued by Elaine Holmstad and a bevy of skiing beauties. The new downhill course which winds through the trees was christened in the afternoon and a course record was established that may not fall for some time. Bob Parker covered the distance in the fantastic time of 4 seconds to capture top honor. Even more remarkable is the fact that Parker won the PNSA Class B Downhill Championship in exactly the same time just a few weeks later. Bob Power was second, 4 seconds behind Parker.

Junior competitor Joanne Chetlain copped the Women's Downhill, followed by Elaine Holmstad. Combined awards were presented for the first time this year and were awarded to Elaine and Bob Power. These are small trophies presented by the club, and can be kept permanently by the winner.

Several other race were held at Meany during the season for club members only. Typical of these was the New Year's Giant Slalom which saw Norm Welsh and Grace Bovee burn down a lightning fast course to take top honors.

Other sterling efforts were made by many of our competitors. Bob Cram came in 35th (absolutely last) in the Golden Pole at Hood, and Alan Taylor came in 29th. Taylor remained remarkably consistent, the slender flyer roaring in 25th in the Heather Cup Giant Slalom at Mt. Baker on the 4th of July. In the same race, Cranston and Roberts had a rough time in Class A, coming in near the end. The Mountaineer team was disqualified in the Penguin Giant Slalom because some of our boys got lost somewhere on the course.

That's about it for now, but you ain't seen nothing yet. We're planning competition for the coming year that should result in some swell compound fractures!

MEANY Memoranda
by Claire Mock

IT WAS all a matter of pride and pocketbook-you could uphold your pride and save your pocketbook by hiking in like a true Mountaineer, or take the train, and swallow your pride, at the same time unbalancing the budget. One particular weekend, we were glad we had chosen the latter course. Three stalwarts and their dates left Meany Hut Sunday night in a gathering snow storm. We will not recount their minor mishaps, but only say their feelings did not run high when they reached the highway at long last only to find the road closed. About ready to crawl into a snowdrift, to freeze and to die, they managed to find enough strength to hie themselves to Snoqualmie Lodge, there to await the reopening of the road. Unfortunately, it was opened the next morning, so not too many classes were lost.

Many weekends, about ten of us would take the train on Friday night. We'd bring our dinner to eat on the train, and piping hot cocoa, prepared as soon as we arrived, would fortify us against freezing in the dorms. We felt like very good Samaritans when the crowd arrived Saturday mornings to find a warm welcome; and by warm we mean heat and hot water.

Mountaineers are most ingenious, but their ingenuity was taxed the week end the food did not arrive till Sunday noon. From staples on hand, about 40 people were served nutritious, if uninteresting meals-after all, there's a limit to what one can do with beans; but then, needless to say, Sunday night we really had a feast.

The heavy snowfall last winter was a mixed blessing. We'll never complain about too much snow, but maybe the ski tow boys felt differently. Many hours were spent laboriously tunneling through thirty or more feet of snow to free the rope and shives. While six or eight fellows worked on the tow, the rest of us would pack the hill. Mountaineers are swell people! And then the fun began. Beautiful snow, and a hill in fine shape, made skiing this year the best ever. Ski classes were held and many novices were soon holding their own with intermediates. The intermediate challenged the advanced skiers, and they in turn, were outschussing the schussers. Each day found a skillful group practicing a tricky slalom course. The skill they developed was demonstrated by their fine showing in many races.

Evenings at Meany were like a skier's version of You Can't Take It with You. While some are still busy with K.P., others are studying, bridge groups form, a crowd shouts over a game of Pick Up Sticks, kibitzers knit, and many a fastcap is turned out to flash down the hill a short time hence. The phonograph no longer plays miscellaneous records, folk tunes come to the fore. Soon boots are discarded and the crowd of dancers increases, old steps are taught to newcomers and new steps are learned by all.

Falling leaves indicate another ski season very soon. Time to make ready our gear and prepare for the slopes. Besides, our tall stories are stale by now; another season will provide a fresh supply; we can't wait for it to arrive!

The Spacious Spaces

A review of the past year shows that the skiers were blessed with a tremendous fall of snow and consequently, a season which never did quite end ... August and September rolled around, and still there was good snow at comparatively low altitudes. And for many of us, the November to July dates were filled on most week-ends with the pleasures which skiing brings. A slow scare in organizing committees delayed some of the planned functions; even so, most of our objectives were accomplished.

MUSING AT MEANY
RICHARD STARK

The mellow, echoing whistle of a stream liner as it crawls through the valley below brings one to pause and reflect on the serenity of the hillside on which he stands. As the diminished sixth sound waves fade into stillness, the eyes rest on, and suddenly become aware of ... a symphony of reds, browns and golds. In the near distance, dull hacking sounds of a lazy axe clearing a downhill run are heard in audible accompaniment. An occasional yodel penetrates the crisp air in anticipation of the coming season of skis.

Low at first ... then shrill, the siren sounds gladsome proclamation chat dinner is ready. The green woods quickly belch forth happy workers who come stumbling through the rouge twilight. Ready to receive the onrushing avalanche is the volunteer kitchen crew-ready with Spanish rice and meat balls ... ready with ginger cake and whipped cream-ready with a list of names to help clean up the kitchen.

Evening chores finished, each Mountaineer settles to his or her reverie, either active or passive. For there is dancing, folk and modern. Shelves weigh heavily with discs of Hambos and Schortisches, Polkas and Fox Trots. There are nervous games of pick-up-sticks. There is a Canasta tournament. There are books to peruse and tall tales to be heard and told. Then, one by one, drowsing figures move upwards to the bunks and sleeping bags. A bit of banter between the dormitories...then sleep.

The somber pines outside keep lonely vigil awaiting the morn that will witness still more activity, willingly performed by those who have found peace here. A blanket of cobalt...star-studded...overhead lends calm refuge. The night breeze plays a lullaby upon the strings of nature. The hillside composes a tone poem of nocturnal ecstasy.

Dawn arrives all too soon, but the aroma of frying bacon gradually lures even the most profound sleeper from the depths of lethargy into he heights of action. The roof needs reshingling. Wood needs cutting, coal needs hauling and the tow mechanism needs attention.

There is still good fellowship to be had and Gavey is there to distribute it evenly.

Then another work party has slipped further towards long-awaited winter. Reluctant souls return to the city to anxiously scan weather reports in daily hope of snowfall.

Then it happens! First shining crystals are formed on leaf and twig. The hillside sparkles with a carpet of ermine. A myriad of diamonds gleams in the morning sun...harbingers of the season of schuss and slalom. Tall pine and mountain hemlock yawningly stretch many arms into a heaven of profoundest blue. Days pass, bringing drifts of powdery snow...over which skis glide with a light swishing sound, their passage lifting the snow in a scintillating cloud. The determined hum of whirring sheaves invites novice and expert alike to ever-new delights.

The perpetual warmth and welcome of the hut awaits chilled ear and frosty nose. Domestic odors of baking cake and roasting meat permeate the alpine atmosphere, provoking lusty appetites. Nashie is at home in the kitchen. We are at home with our selves and nature. We are at Meany.

A WINTER AT MEANY
by Coleman S. Leuthy

Autumn is in the air as the work parties get under-way at Meany late in September.

Numerous tasks confront us which must be done before the snow flies, but the most important is to transport the coal from rail to flat car and thence to the hut with the faithful aid of the "Beast" (our beloved Fordson Tractor), which draws our antiquated trailer. From the forest comes the clear ring of falling axes and busy saws as the fellows build up a winter's supply of wood for the furnace.

When the loggers quit at dusk, the cabin lights blink on and the smell of coffee and dinner preparation greets the tired workers. A completely satisfying dinner calls for a period of relaxation and gossip before heavy boots and sweaters are shed for lighter gear and the evening of folk dancing begins. Eleven o'clock comes all too soon, even though muscles welcome a soft bunk and a good night's rest.

Each weekend the autumn color become more vivid-the aspen, cottonwood, mountain ash, vine maple and even the huckleberries add their splendor to the scene. As work is completed at the top of the Lane, we notice a definite edge to the wind; and before the final touches are made on the lodge there is a sprinkling of snow. Time to get our ski equipment out, patch it up a bit, and give the boards a silky-smooth base coat.

The snow falls heavier now, and suddenly the long-awaited Christmas vacation is upon us and skiers of every size and description descend upon the hut. The Lane is covered with new powder snow, no stumps or rocks mar its perfection, and the skiers glide down the hill in happy abandon. Some look like pros, and some sitzmark a bit. At dusk the dorms are in a bedlam as a result of everyone trying to clean up for the big evening ahead. The chow hounds line up well before the siren announces dinner. They want to be sure not to miss a huge helping of Nashie's wonderful cooking! And of course the season would not be complete without Nashie, resplendent in her gay hand-painted apron, as cook, confidant, bridge partner and train companion during the many weeks of ski season. New Year's Eve culminates a week of fun and gaiety with a big party. Schouisches, hambos, polkas, waltzes and fox trots resound through the cabin, and as midnight draws near a snow battle royal throws everything into laughing confusion.

The holiday is over but the season is just beginning. Friday night finds the hardier skiers winding their way across a vast white carpet of glittering snow crystals, the moon light casting shadows of majestic trees across their path. More skiers plod in from the highway Saturday, but the majority come tumbling off the train Saturday morning, having taken over a car with their singing and story-telling during their trip from Seattle or from Kanasket. Many find the 36-mile drive from Seattle to Kanasket on a surfaced, snow free road a truly "safe and sane approach to winter driving in the mountains"-and a money-saver too!

At the first hint of Spring in the air the more ambitious people take to climbers and explore the varied terrain of the Meany Woods and Stampede Pass-Weather Station area. The warm sunny weekends make for lazy relaxed ski days, and as April winds eat the snow away, it is just one last run down the [Lane](Lane). One practically hops from snow patch to snow patch, and it is quite definite to even the most avid skier that another Season is over at Meany.

Meany Ski Hut
Jo Anne Feringer

Last winter there were many who came to Meany, skiing in the three miles from the highway or driving to Kanasket and connecting with the train to Martin. Dale Turner proved an able hut chairman, and it was a good year. More people found that touring proved the best antidote for too concentrated "tow skiing", and found deep snow skiing a new challenge. A full day took them to Baldy; the Stampede weather station made an easy half-day trip; less than an hour found them at Meany woods for a thrilling series of sweeping turns into the bowl, a bit of traversing, and the final run down the gully and along the ridge to the top of the tow. There the anticipation of a dinner prepared by chef and gourmet supreme, Mrs. [Harry Iverson](Harry-Iverson), made short work of the run down to the Hut. If they could still muster the energy after dinner, [Art Nation](Art-Nation) would be ready with his fine collection of folk dance records and a helping hand for the novices.

[Bill Brockman](Bill-Brockman), assisted by [Dick Feringer](Dick-Feringer), has taken over the chairmanship for the coming season, and if the work parties are any criteria, it should be an enthusiastic one. With the combination of ideal weather and large groups of eager workers each weekend, a surprising amount has been accomplished. Members will first notice the kitchen (and shed a sentimental tear for the old coal range). Mr. Morris of the gas company still wonders how, in a few hours of apparently complete disorganization, the new stove and heater were carried in; cylinders brought up and installed; everything put in working order; and his tools all returned to the box. That intangible Mountaineer spirit must be potent! Next will be noticed the work of skilled laborers (those who proved they could hit a nail oftener than their fingers) in the building of the fire wall and doors in the stairway; and that other fire preventative measures have been taken with extra hoses and kick-out doors, and emergency exits and lamps.

Out on the Hill skiers will find that the brushing gang has given the Lane a crew cut, and that two days with a chain saw provided a basement full of wood. They will tighten their ski bindings in anticipation when they see the new terrain which has been opened up by the running of the new Bonneville power line parallel to the Lane; a wide lane having been cleared to feed into the bottom of the tow.

A special award of merit has been awarded to the tractor which had been retired years ago to be a tow motor and is now a tractor again, running on some mysterious, magical ingredient, and nursed tenderly by Norm Welch to perform prodigious feats of strength for its advanced age.

Meany Ski Hut
[Dick Feringer](Dick-Feringer), Chairman

I remember the first time I came to Meany-passing the familiar scenery over Snoqualmie Pass, turning off by Rustic Inn, winding over the narrow dirt road to Martin, and hiking up the short path to the lodge. Disappointment descended on me like the misty rain clouds which hung in the valley. This brown barnlike building seemed very colorless on this grey day. I remembered the tales told of this place, and at this moment couldn't share such enthusiasm.

My first introduction to Mountaineers, other than car companions, was upon joining six weary and drenched fellows standing around a Smithsonian model Fordson tractor which they claimed would run, but looked to me as though it should have been melted up some time before I was born. Every automotive theory I had ever heard was being advanced as to why it wouldn't start.

p. 56

A short time later, after being appointed as a volunteer to cut wood, I was slogging up a path leading into the woods, drying off the underbrush with my pants. During that rainy October day the wood seemed to grab at the saws at every stroke. After an hour or so our work was interrupted by a loud noise which sounded like something between a steam locomotive and a drag saw charging through the brush. To my utter amazement, the tractor appeared carrying out its much needed task.

By the end of the day I was wet, cold and tired, and wondering how long my association with the Mountaineers would last. A warm meal saved the day. I don't know what Nashie put in the casserole, but I was astonished to see that most of the people danced the rest of the evening!

The next day, as during the first, confusion seemed to reign. People were milling around in all directions. Most of the help appeared obviously inexpert and a complete lack of organization, I was sure, existed. Sunday afternoon I skidded down off the hill with the handles of several axes cutting into my shoulder and was amazed at the size of the woodpile by the basement door. An incredible amount of work had been accomplished! The dam was cleaned out, the water line repaired, a new tow rope had been spliced into place, and cleaning and painting on the main floor definitely improved the looks of the hut.

The weather was kinder on the succeeding work parties, and the companionship and spirit of new acquaintances made them much more fun. After five such weekends the wood was all in, the machinery in good working order, the hut scrubbed, and everything was ready for nature to take its course and bring forth snow. At the end of that last work party people sat by the window, looking at the cloudy sky like a girl sitting by the phone on Saturday night.

p. 57

With the coming of winter the lodge shrank into a roof sitting on the snow and gave the impression of a man who had pulled his hat down over his ears. The familiar inside of the lodge convinced me this was still Meany, and the warm cozy fire and friendly skiers transformed the hut into a comfortable island in the middle of the cold wilderness.

There were still more experiences in store. One was meeting and getting to know Nashie whose superb cooking and personality provide a focal point about which Meany has revolved for many years. The other was skiing on the [Lane](Lane), that patch of hillside which justified the past months of effort. The variety of ski terrain available, both cross country and downhill, more than balanced the anticipation built up during those first work parties.

By this time I had learned that Meany was companionship; it was felling trees, cutting wood, splicing rope, brushing the hill; it was repairing engines, building, painting, cleaning pots and pans; it was touring in powder snow to the lookout, practicing deep snow skiing, setting up a slalom on the lane; it was also dancing, games, parties, memorable conversations, and good food.

Since those first few work parties, I have seen many improvements go into the hut every year. Last year the Bonneville power line opened up an entire new ski area serviceable by the tow. Old Meanyites call it "Little Sun Valley," claiming it has the terrain of Mount Baldy concentrated in four hundred yards! A new gas stove and water heater have added greatly to the convenience in the kitchen, and improved manicuring techniques on the lane enabled skiing with less than two feet of snow.

Now when I hike up the trail from Martin and the hut comes into sight, a never waning enthusiasm returns, and I feel as though I am coming home.

MEANY SKI HUT
by Joan Merritt

[Lower Slobbovia](Lower-Slobbovia) is situated 100 yards south of the [Lane](Lane) and runs roughly parallel to it. The inhabitants are seasonal. During good snow years they may be heard to utter, "Ha! Gung skiink," and during lesser snow years, "Gung skiink? Ha!" Bonneville still considers the area primarily as a power line and is apparently oblivious to the more important resources, the superb ski slopes and an unusual stand of hemlock.

p. 82

The hemlock comprises the last remaining bit of Slobboviana wilderness and this too might have been lost to future generations but for the vigilance of the Lower Slobbovian Bird Watching Society. They were in a position to observe the immediate dangers to the timber from irresponsible dogs and skiers. But pressure from outside interests finally induced the Society to take drastic action to protect the area.

Thus, all interested parties were invited to a meeting at Meany Ski Hut this past winter to determine the best course of action. Fantastic projects were disclosed by lumber and power representatives, by Bureau of Reclamation and Army Engineers. They ranged from selective logging proposals to plans to completely inundate the area. Bird watching forces rallied to the cause, however, and sentiment for creating a wilderness area ran high among Lower Slobbovians. Senator Jack S. Phogbound pledged his support in helping to create Lower Slobbovia National Park.

The following day, the entire population turned out in a drenching rain to witness the stirring dedication ceremony of the Park. The strains of the Lower Slobbovian National Anthem, "I think that I shall never see a tree," as played by the Snarvish-board Band, were particularly appropriate. And so another bit of original America has been preserved for posterity.

It is hoped that this account may be of some help to the new Skier at Meany who, speeding through Slobbovian snows, comes upon one miserable, misplaced hemlock tree at the brink of a gully and clearly labeled "Lower Slobbovian National Park" and "Leave them flowers be." After such an introduction, Friend Skier will either beat a hasty retreat to Snoqualmie or proclaim enthusiastically, "Gunk skiink hat Meany? Hew bat!"

Meany Ski Hut area saw An Early Epic Struggle
by Keith D. Goodman

Anyone subject to seeing apparitions might well stay indoors and away from windows at night when visiting Meany Ski Hut and environs. This precaution especially is necessary in the dark of the moon when the air is still and a light fog or mist is present.

Ichabod Crane saw the headless horseman many years after that unfortunate individual met the sword. Likewise an imaginative visitor to the area not only has the opportunity to witness all that Ichabod saw, but in addition many more ghosts such as a dozen maimed men, 400 horses and mules, scores of pigtailed Chinamen and a fugitive from justice vainly trying to escape from a sheriff's gunfire.

The cause of the possible ghosts was the construction of the Stampede Tunnel and the switchback over the nearby pass during the years 1886 to 1888. The bore, completed after a dramatic struggle, was at the time the second longest for railroads in the United States, exceeded in length only by the Hoosack in Massachusetts.

From the earlier days of railroads, a line was proposed for the Northwest, but it was not until 1870 that the Northern Pacific started building from Duluth to Puget Sound. The last spike was driven in 1883. The trains, after leaving Pasco, ran over tracks of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Co., down the south bank of the Columbia River to Portland thence by car ferry from Goble to Kalama and finally on Northern Pacific rails to Tacoma, the terminus. Travelers to Seattle had to complete their trip by boat.

Plans were completed in 1884 to build a line directly from Pasco through some mountain pass to Tacoma. George B. McClellan, later the general of Civil War fame; and Isaac I. Stevens, the territorial governor, made scouting trips in the late '50s for suitable routes.

Virgil G. Bogue, assistant engineer for the railroad, discovered four passes near each other three of which he designated by numerals. The fourth he called Cedar Pass because it led to the Cedar River. He selected Pass No. 1 which he had located in March of 1881. The NorthernPacific had practically chosen Naches which was favorable to Tacoma.

Seattle's choice was Snoqualmie. Bogue proceeded from Ellensburg in April of 1883 and located the present tunnel site.

In Herbert Hunt's Tacoma, Its History and Its Builders and in a magazine article written in 1884 by Eugene V. Smalley, a NorthernPacific publicity man, can be gleaned the story of how the pass was named.

A party of trail cutters was encamped at the lake in the pass in the summer of 1880. A dispute arose between the axemen and their foreman. All of the men quit their jobs and hurriedly left the camp with the exception of a Johnny Bradley from Pierce County. He fastened to a nearby tree a piece of board, marking it with pencil, "Stampede Camp," because the dissenters stampeded down the trail.

Nelson Bennett, once a brakeman but later a railroad and mining contractor, was notified January 21, 1886, that he had been awarded the contract to build the proposed Stampede Tunnel. The figure, not clearly stated by writers of the day was around $1 million.

Bennett lost no time in getting underway. With the rail-head at Yakima, he had to construct a road over ridges, valleys and streams, some 92 miles of it, to the future Tunnel City -now Martin-plus five more winding miles to the west portal. The contractor appointed his brother, Capt Sidney J. Bennett as general superintendent.

Hauling a ton of supplies from Yakima to Meany Ski Hut with a four-horse team in January would be quite a chore on the roads of today. It would take at least four or five days in summer and perhaps three times that long in winter.

According to the Tacoma Ledger of May 26, 1886, the Bennetts began work at the east portal on Lincoln's Birthday, in snow that was from six to ten feet deep. The bore was to be 9,850 feet long, 22 feet high and 16½, feet wide or a total of about 122,000 cubic yards of volcanic rock to be removed.

A cut had to be made opposite the spot where the present employees now live; a 700-foot approach filled and leveled; hand drllls, hammer and blasting materials had to be hauled in; cookhouse, bunkhouse, warehouse and other wooden structures had to be erected before tunneling could begin. These preliminary operations involved an expenditure of $125,000.

The foregoing edition of the Tacoma Ledger described in flowery language the waterfall at entrance of the proposed tunnel. The height given was 180 feet with a beauty exceeding that of Multnomah Falls near the Columbia River. This Stampede cascade of water gave trouble. A dam constructed to divert it gave way and the workmen below were flooded out. Before repairs could be made the water froze at the portal causing a long delay until could be removed.

By May 26, so the Ledger stated, 200 men were working at the east portal on three eight-hour shifts, There were 156 men on the west side plus six families.

To reach the west portal, a trail, at first through 12 feet of snow, had to be dug out to transport equipment by mule back.

The article in the Ledger stated there was a saloon, restaurant and hospital in Tunnel City. With the absence of suitable flat areas even to this day around Martin, one wonders where these edifices stood.

As fast as the bore was cut, timbering was resorted to on the east side. Twelve by twelves were segmented every two to four feet to hold up the ceiling. Timbers were cut for the west side, stacked near the portal but apparently never were used. Two sawmills, one at Teanaway, a new town 20 miles west of Ellensburg, and the other at Cabin Creek, eight miles east of the tunnel, furnished the big squares.

The first round-trip train from Pasco to Ellensburg made the run Sunday, April 11, with railroad officials aboard according to the Ellensburg Localizer in its edition of April 17, 1886. The paper stated the wagon road to Tunnel City had been much improved and that a Mr. Wisner was working on a contract to haul by team supplies and light machinery to the tunnel. During the preceding week he had hauled 3,400 pounds to within four miles of the job. President Wright of the NorthernPacific arrived in Tacoma April 30, 1886, and stated a switchback would be built over Stampede Pass to be completed if possible by November or Christmas with through trains by that time. A proposal had been made to make it a cog-wheel line over the steepest grade. The rail fficials figured it would cost $300,000 to build the switchback which would save the road $100,000 a year until the tunnel was completed; then it would be used as a road for tourists and "scientific investigations."

Although Bennett was opposed to Chinese labor, an order was placed in mid July of 1886 for 2,000 of them to work along the line. These laborers all wore pigtails and in the event of death the contractor was obliged to ship the body back to China.

It was nearly two years before the two crews in the tunnel began hearing each other's blasts, the latter part of March, 1888. Finally on May 3, the shot that produced daylight Was fired. The job was completed 11 days later.

Two locomotives, Ceta and Sadie, pulled the first train, through the tunnel, seven days ahead of schedule. Ceta and Sadie were Nelson Bennett's two daughters. In all the history of railroading before or since that time, very few cars or locomotives bore feminine names.

Meantime, the switchback which was started In July of 1886 was completed with all its zigzags and the first train, pulled by the largest locomotive ever built, puffed over the line on June 6, 1887. On the 25th the first vestibuled coach in Washington territory passed over the line carrying 30 tourists.

Very little remains to remind one of the epic struggle that took place in the late '80s. The old grades of the switchbacks have been all most entirely obliterated by power lines their access roads. The lake still is in the pass, half surrounded by brush. The charred and blackened snags left by the fire of 1884 have been bleached white by snows.

One can guess where the Chinese village stood near the small body of water. To the southeast on a knoll is a modern weather station and a forest service lookout tower. Acres of huckleberry and mountain ash bushes in season color the landscape in every direction! The berries furnished food and cash for the Muckleshoot Indians during depression days. The pickers, squaws and all, made the trip from near Auburn through the courtesy (?) of NorthernPacific "side-door Pullmans."

The waterfall at the east portal still spills over the tunnel's end and a snow shed protects the approach as it did in construction days. Tunnel City with its workshops, warehouses, hospital, restaurant and saloon are gone. A station house labeled "Martin" and few employees' cottages have replaced the town.

The writer would not be so brash as to say that Meany Ski Hut stands on the site of the old saloon, or that whiskey bottles, collection item-class, of course, rest hidden in the nearby weeds.

MEANY SKI HUT
(Nashie's 20th Anniversary)
by Bob Cram

It goes without saying that the past season at Meany was another outstanding year of sliding. No person has ever been heard to dispute the fact that Meany has the finest slopes ever to be serviced by a single rope tow in the entire Northwest, nor has anyone disputed the fact that the conviviality of the assembled multitudes is surpassed by none.

The popularity of the place is somewhat evident when you start turning people away from the work parties. As if these things weren't enough, the crowning glory to the whole place, the frosting on the cake, the queen of the kitchen, the girl of our dreams, is of course Nashie Iverson who reigns each weekend by her stove, ladling out equal amounts of steaming chow and good home cooked advice to the lovelorn. She has done thusly for 20 years and is now shooting for 40.

It seemed only right, then, for us to show some sort of appreciation for the unrelenting pounding that Nashie has undergone these past two decades in her never ending pursuit of satiating the monstrous appetites of skiers. So last March we all got together to pay tribute and there were people who hadn't seen Nashie in years that came to say "howdy" and pass the time of day in the kitchen. The hut was filled to capacity and we had a big banquet, giving Nashie the place of honor and an orchid corsage, and there was a big decorated cake and a marvelous roast beef dinner that Nashie, naturally, had prepared.

After dinner, the Meany Players, direct from a successful run at the Snoqualmie Pass Warming Hut, presented a stirring dramatization of "Through the Years at Meany, Its Sights and Sounds." This giant epic portrayed the grim struggle against the wilderness that took place in the establishing of Meany as a ski and cultural center and the big part that Nashie played in its growth. It was real corny but some people will laugh at any thing and Meanyites are among them.

Then we gave Nashie some gifts as a small token of everyones' appreciation for all the things she had done for us-like listen to our troubles and sort of help get people together and cook meals and show us how to fix sweet potatoes just right and tell us what she might do if it was her who was trying to make some feller pay attention to her and about 40 million other things she has done. You don't just get it all off your chest in one evening after a gal has given you 20 of the best years of her life, but we at Meany believe Nashie wouldn't keep coming back year after year if she didn't like us just about one-tenth as much as we love her.

She's going to be around for awhile, we're sure because we're really planning a blast for her 40th anniversary and you know what a party girl Nashie is.

Other ski names to be added: [Ernest Harris](Ernest-Harris) was appointed first ski chairman, December 8, 1927. His committee selected the Martin site and he directed the building of Meany Ski Hut. [William J. Maxwell](Bill-Maxwell) helped him throughout and developed ski leadership. Other early leaders were T. Dexter Everts, Norval W. Grigg, Paul Shorrock, Andrew W. Anderson, Herman P . Wunderling, Hans-Otto Giese and Edna F. Walsh, all members of the two ski committees.

p. 16

Parallel in growth with climbing has been the enthusiasm for skiing. In 1932, the Annual notes that Mountaineers are exploring their mountain domain on skis. In 1931 Mount Baker had been conquered and in the years that followed many of the more accessible peaks were climbed. The 18-mile trail between Snoqualmie Lodge and Meany Ski Hut at times resembled a thoroughfare and many other areas were visited by the mountaineer-skier as technique and equipment improved, and transportation via automobile throughout the entire year was readily available.

p. 18

Meany Ski Hut also grew in popularity with the skiers, for which it is especially designed. First interest of the country around was due to the vast area of denuded hills on [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill) and around Stampede Pass but as the forest grew these sections became less usable, with the result that in 1938 a ski tow was constructed to take full advantage of the [Lane](Lane). This proved so popular that in 1939 it was necessary to build an addition to the hut, doubling its capacity. During the gas-rationed war years the availability of train service made the Hut a mecca for all who loved to ski. Early in the '50s, the construction of a Bonneville Power Administration power line across the southwest portion of the property provided another exciting ski slope ([Lower Slobbovia](Lower-Slobbovia) for the more expert skier; and in 1956 the ski tow is being remodeled and moved to a location which will take advantage of both the lane and the power hill. Perhaps symbolic of Meany is Annie Iverson, "Nashie" to most of us, who has been cooking and dispensing philosophical advice for over 25 years (see story on page 57).

The Story of Meany Ski Hut
by [Fred W. Ball](Fred-Ball)

Probably few of the skiers who use Meany Hut today are aware that the 60-acre site was a gift from our revered president, Dr. Edmond S. Meany. This was in 1928-long before the advent of many of its present devotees.

The story of Meany's development is inter-woven with the growth of skiing in the northwest which began about 1915-16, the centers of activity being Snoqualmie Lodge and Paradise. By 1926-27, however, the sport had become so popular that Snoqualmie Lodge was bursting with skiers throughout the winter and more facilities were needed.

Special outings at Stampede led some of our early skiers over the pass to the Meany area where the favorable terrain and accessibility by train (no backpacking!) impressed them. These early explorers were enthused by the open areas around the present weather station, the power line hill, and the magnificent open timber of [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill)-all ideally suited to the ski touring which dominated the sport.

Following the winter of 1927-28 further explorations of the area led to a favorable decision and in June 1928 plans for the building were presented to a special meeting of the Board of Trustees. These plans called for a 20x50 two-story frame building to accommodate 50 people. It was to be a plain ski shelter without luxurious embellishments. (The total absence of these could be verified by any of the early visitors having occasion to arise in the night.) The project was approved and $1,700 appropriated for construction.

Dr. Meany purchased and donated the land, approximately 64 acres. Generous donations were also made by the Everett and Tacoma branches. Materials were shipped by rail to Martin, unloaded by the enthusiastic volunteer workers and carried to the site by hand, some help from the railroad section hands through the skillful cajolery of [W. J. Maxwell](Bill-Maxwell) plus a small cash consideration.

Construction was started in September 1928 and on November 11 the building was dedicated by Dr. Meany with about 100 members and guests present. Much interior work remained to be done but by the time winter arrived the hut was ready for occupancy and was filled to capacity throughout the season. While rough, it was comfortable, with the big hotel range in the kitchen and the potbellied coal stove in the main room giving off a cheery glow; on the wire rack overhead wet socks, mittens and other gear dried or nicely browned, depending on the owner's alertness. Gasoline lanterns furnished light but after a day of climbing up and sliding down the hills, early to bed was the rule, for tomorrow was another day. Those fortunate ones who could come on the Friday evening or Saturday morning train formed a welcoming committee with hot chocolate and doughnuts for the less fortunate arriving Saturday night. A brief visit and exchange of greetings around the big stove and then "lights out!"

The winters of 1928-31 were devoted to touring the surrounding country. Numerous trips were made to [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill), the telephone cabin, Stampede Pass, Baldy, and Stirrup Lake. Snowshoe Butte was claimed but never substantiated.

These winters also saw the beginning of ski races at Meany. The cross-country races for men and women for the University Book Store trophies began in 1929. The slalom and downhill races for men began in 1930, for trophies donated by [Bob Hayes](Robert-Hayes) and [W. J. Maxwell](Bill-Maxwell), respectively. The first patrol race was also run this year, finishing at Meany.

This pattern of activity continued for the next several years, the tours expanding until trips from the Lodge to Meany or vice versa became almost commonplace, a party of public-spirited members having marked the route by orange-colored tin shingles high on trees and placed so that one was always in sight ahead.

The intervening summers were spent in clearing [Hell's Half Acre](Hell's-Half-Acre), laying and relaying water lines and other necessary work. In 1931 two loggers from Easton contracted to fall the trees from the cornice down to the clearing for $100 and so the lane was created. Unfortunately the loggers were careless, or the trees perverse, for they fell in a jumble, requiring an outlay of another $100 the following summer to clean up the slash and reduce the fire hazard, which also improved the skiability.

At first the lower lane was used as a practice slope, the remainder being only a convenient means of going to and from the upper slopes of [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill). The more expert used its entire length to some extent but three or four climbs and descents were enough for even the strongest on any one day.

p. 56

The downhill races started at the edge of the timber near the top of [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill), each man choosing his own course to the finish at the bottom of the lane. Always some tried to "run it straight" and some spectacular eggbeaters resulted but strangely enough there were never any serious injuries. As a deterrent to such folly the overhead beam in [The Hut](The-Hut) had an array of broken skis mounted on it and over them the warning: "THEY TOOK IT STRAIGHT."

A mysterious schism among the skiers developed with the advent of the ski hut. [Snoqualmie Lodge](Snoqualmie-Lodge) was a place of gaiety and entertainment as well as skiing, with its huge fireplace, phonograph and space enough for dancing. Meany Hut, however, was conceived and approved as strictly a shelter for skiers, with no fireplace or extra space. There was plenty of gaiety and fun but of a different kind and apparently this difference caused some to prefer one place to the other. Thus, while there were those who alternated, the skiers in general were identified as either "Lodge hounds" or "Meanyites."

Almost imperceptibly through these years changes were developing in the pattern of Meany activities. Slalom proficiency, at first sought chiefly as an aid to touring, began to emerge as an end unto itself. Rope tows were appearing in more and more areas, and as they increased, touring declined, finally bringing a major change in the Meany way of life. Again the members labored mightily and by the winter of 1938-39 a rope tow was completed, with a 15x20-foot log cabin to house its tractor power plant.

Also the original conception of the hut as merely a shelter no longer met the popular demand. More active indoor entertainment required more space and so the second major change was made--the hut had its face lifted. In 1939 another concerted effort resulted in a 24x30-foot, three story addition with a basement containing a furnace, drying room, waxing room, washroom, and - at last! - inside plumbing.

<img src="img/1945%20Meany%20Ski%20Hut.png" style="width: 450px;" align="right" alt="Meany Ski Hut, 1945">

The main floor comprised a recreation room, with a ping-pong table, a phonograph and space for dancing or games. The second floor became sleeping quarters for men, the third floor comprising another innovation-married quarters. The addition increased the hut capacity to 75 people. A light plant had previously been installed and so life at Meany had indeed changed considerably.

During the early years it was difficult to find a suitable cook who could be available regularly. In 1935 the committee induced the one and only Nashie to take over and she has become a fixture as well as friend, counselor and confessor. Long may she reign!

Hut committees, in the early years had excellent cooperation from the railroad and in turn worked closely with it. Train schedules were convenient, allowing a full day of skiing plus time for dinner and cleanup. A special car was provided for parties of 15 or more and permitted all kinds of impromptu entertainment. Fares were high at first, around $3.80 a round trip, but were negotiated downward from time to time to a low of $1.80.

However during the war years extra cars were not available and fares went up again. By this time the highways had been improved to the point that access by automobile was feasible. Also train schedules had been changed from time to time and were no longer so convenient, so travel by automobile became increasingly popular. At this writing it is rumored that other changes in train schedules are being considered which would very likely see the end of rail transportation to Meany and complete another major change in former customs.

Over the years Meany Ski Hut has become more than just "a good place to ski." It has become a monument and a continuing tribute to Mountaineer tradition and to the many who devoted their time, thought and energy to its creation and its development from the beginning down through the years to the present. May it continue to be so!

My Years at Meany

by Mrs Harry K. (Nashie) Iverson

I REMEMBER the first time I came to Meany - for the New Year's celebration of 1934-5. Never in all my life had I met such a queer lot of people was my first impression. Their garb surely set them apart as being out of the ordinary.
It didn't take long to figure out that outdoor sports were not their only interest; they had an interest in everything! After my day's work, it was interesting for me to sit in the shadows and see the romantic intrigue among the bachelors and spinsters, for there was plenty of it. No one paid much attention to the fact that they were being spied upon. My favorite vantage point was sitting underneath the dripping socks that were hung over the old coal stove which in those days provided the only drying facilities.

There was never a dull moment and times haven't changed a bit. Come 11 o'clock, games and merriment of the evening were over and time to bed down. In the women's dorm we were nightly entertained by Sally's ballet dance costumed in fancy scanties. After breakfast some of the hardier skiers packed a lunch and took off for Mount Baldi which was an all day trip. The party consisted of Norm Engle, Herman Wunderling and Paul and Gertrude Shorrock. The less eager played around [Hell's Half Acre](Hell's-Half-Acre) climbing up under their own steam.

On Washington's birthday, a three-day holiday, the hut was filled to capacity with 60 people. The rain came down in torrents keeping everyone inside, except a few who now and then would venture out for a breath of air and return soaking wet. Even so the roof billowed with hilarity, and chairman [Jack Hassock](Jack-Hassock) said: "Nashie, I bet you have never been housed with so many 'nuts' before!" He was right, but I will say this: they were and still are the greatest in the land.

In 1937 the Juniors began entering the club and life took on added color, which on occasion turned to a dull gray. The Seniors found the Juniors taking over the place. To many of them this meant doom, but surprisingly enough the Juniors became rapidly adjusted and did themselves proud by assuming the necessary responsibilities and adding new and novel entertainment.

Within the next year growing pains overtook the lodge and it was decided to build an addition to the hut. All the skillful eager beavers gathered around and with much toil and perspiration the dream came into being. It came to me as a revelation what ability and cooperation could and did accomplish. Even the artistic touch appeared in Boyd Bucey's scallop trim over the windows.

One of the recent outstanding events was the dedication of [Lower Slobbovia](Lower-Slobbovia) which was described by Ernie as a "masterpiece," Dick Merritt as "Mr. Fog Bound," Joan as a "Bird Watcher" and Roy Snider as "Custodian of All the Out-of-Doors." There were others too, such as [Art Nation](Art-Nation), "genius of music and dance," and [Walter Little](Walter-Little) with "work and wisdom and years of experience." I could go on and on but it all sums up to the fact that the Seniors helped the Juniors and vice versa-and all live at Meany in peace and harmony.

My greatest satisfaction has been to watch the growth of character that has come from this close association. It is not possible for one to weigh or measure the far-reaching influence that these relationships have on the people who meet here, but I feel sure that they carry with them a most pleasant and lasting memory.

The relocated tow at Meany provided better access to lanes and eliminated the necessity of digging out the upper part of the rope. The big social event of the season was the dedication of the new tow to [Walter Little](Walter-Little).

While ski lodge construction was concentrated at Mount Baker: good skiing seasons were reported from Mountaineer lodges at Snoqualmie, Stevens and Meany, as well as Mount Baker. However, light snowfall and unusually warm weather combined to shorten the season. In the only lodge summary submitted for this report, Meany listed attendance of 928 for the season from December 26 through March 30.

A hundred and eighty-four persons attended the Annual Banquet April 11 in the Hotel Edmond Meany. Featured speaker was Dr. Win Bird of the University of Washington Speech Department. Entertainment was provided by the Players and the Lower Slobbovian National Orchestra of Meany Ski Lodge.

In April 1960, the Northern Pacific Railroad removed its trains No. 5 and No. 6, making Meany Ski Lodge accessible only over three miles of snow. The Meany Ski Hut Committee was authorized to negotiate a lease for the use of a snow tractor during the 1960-61 ski season, the final terms of the lease to be subject to the approval of the President. This snow cat might be described as the longest rope tow in the Northwest, serving to tow a rope load of skiers as well as hauling food, duffel and the injured to and from Highway 10.

At Meany Ski Hut the snow-tractor operation proved so successful during the first months of use that the Board of Trustees approved the purchase of the tractor which had been rented initially on a lease-with-option-to-buy basis. Good use was made of the large numbers turning out for work parties by completely overhauling the light plant, rebuilding the front porch and stairs, and putting a new cabin on the snow tractor.

MOUNTAINEER SKIING by [Fred Ball](Fred-Ball)

I came to Seattle in November, 1927...During these years members branched out from the Lodge and Meany more and more when snow conditions were good as their proficiency increased. The Rock Slide and [Hell's Half Acre](Hell's-Half-Acre) always had their quota of people practicing turns; but trips to Olallie Meadows, Silver Peak, Mirror Lake, Divide and Surveyors Lakes from the Lodge and to Baldy, Stampede Pass, the Power Line Cabin, and Meany Woods from Martin were frequently made by large and small groups. Also during this time the route from the Lodge to Meany was pioneered and then marked by orange tin shingles high on trees. This became a popular, if rugged, trip for the more hardy skiers.

Ski Races, 1929-1933

p. 22

The trip between the Lodge and Martin became very popular about the time the Patrol Races started. The initial scouting trip was made in February, 1928, coincident with the first special ski outing at Stampede. A sizable group started from the [Snoqualmie Lodge](Snoqualmie-Lodge), traveling by contour map, compass, and faith, expecting to join the party at Stampede Saturday night...

p. 106

The "longest rope tow in the Northwest"-The Snow-Cat to Meany Ski Hut-was the life-line which kept the hut as popular as ever during the 1962 ski season, having on occasion, upwards to 85 persons. During the work party season, construction of a power line from the Northern Pacific Railroad tracks to the Hut was started after an agreement had been consummated with the railroad for power and the project had been authorized by the Board of Trustees.

p. 107

The line which will be used to serve the power requirements of the Hut will be completed during the 1963 work parties. The bridge on the road to the hut at the foot of the hill below the Northern Pacific tracks washed out again during a chinook storm this fall, requiring a Herculean effort to replace it just before the start of the 1962-63 ski season.

PROPERTIES DIVISION

The snow drought, which affected the entire 1962-63 ski season throughout the West, left its mark on our own ski areas, particularly Meany Ski Hut and Snoqualmie Lodge. The ironic aspect of it was the heavy snowfall during the first part of December, 1962, accompanied by a cold snap. This made it appear as though we were headed for an outstanding ski season.

With this excellent skiing so early in the season, everyone's enthusiasm bubbled at a furious rate. Then the rains came! The next adequate fall of snow came in March-a little late to salvage the season.

Meany Ski Hut's operation for the entire season was limited to the Christmas vacation period, and approximately three weekends in January and February.

A serious case of vandalism took place in the hut this summer. Considerable damage was done by two young men who were subsequently apprehended by the Kittitas County Sheriff's Department.
Puget Sound Power and Light, which initially constructed a power line across Meany property during the summer of 1962 without permission from the Mountaineers, has replaced the overhead power line with one that now runs underground.

Meany's own power supply line from the Northern Pacific Railroad was completed this fall as planned.

Heavy snowfall for the 1963-64 season insured good skiing at all lodges. Meany's snow-cat just made it through the winter before the cat's tracks wore out; the Board of Trustees voted funds to buy a new set for the coming season.

Ski Lodges

The 1964-65 ski season was very successful during January, February, and March. However, attendance dropped rapidly with the approach of spring even though skiing conditions were excellent, with better than average snowfall and ample sunshine. While attendance was down at some lodges, it was up at others, so that an overall surplus was realized after all expenses and depreciation.

Meany Hut installed a new head pole for the ski tow, widened the road to the hut from the railroad right of way, and overhauled the snocat.

Following a successful ski season, lodge committees turned their attention to building repairs and slope maintenance operations. The drainfield at Mt. Baker Lodge has been relocated. All stumps have been removed from the transmission line right-of-way known at Meany as North and South Slobovia. The Snocat's engine was completely rebuilt and is expected to last several years. Other work concentrated on the Meany Hut. A new septic tank and sewer system were installed. The hut's foundation was replaced, and so was the roof. Inside the hut, the women's dorm was painted (white and red), new shelves and mice-proof cupboards were installed in the kitchen, and the drying room facilities were improved.

Another key man was [Jack Hossack](Jack-Hossack)-who in another area of activity designed and built the first ski lift at Meany, against stiff opposition from the Board.

p. 66

When the Ski Committee was formed in 1927 its function was to assist in the development of skiing, supervise the cup races, and to give instruction to beginners. Touring was a natural outgrowth, because of lack of uphill facilities and because of the interest of most members in climbing and related outdoor activities. A major consideration of the Ski committee was increasing facilities for the great number of people who were becoming involved in this sport. After Meany Hut was built in 1928 more cross-country races were held and only after a rope tow was put in at Meany in 1938 were there any uphill conveniences for the hardy enthusiasts who had pioneered.

Happiness is Skiing at Meany-Or Where Else Can You Find a 2-1/2 Mile Long Rope Tow?

It's 7:30 as we leave Seattle. It's cold and crisp with the morning sun shining on new snow in the Cascades. It looks like a great day for the Meanyites as we pass an endless succession of ski-school busses by count, 160, twice the number of people ever seen on [Meany hill](Meany-hill). With Snoqualmie Pass behind us, it is 12 miles to the Stampede Pass exit road. To the left up Gold Creek are Huckleberry and Chikamin Peaks covered with a dusting of new powder snow.

Ten past nine and we pull into the parking area, unload gear and put on skis for the 2-1/2 mile long "ropetow" to the lodge. But where is this rope tow? There is a dog sled with an eager team of white Alaska Huskies ready to take an exercise run up the road, but can they pull 40 skiers? Suddenly an apparition appears around the corner. An immense flat-roofed version of Snoopy's "Sopwith Camel" (doghouse version), gaily painted with alpine flowers and fantastic creatures moves into view. Could that be Snoopy himself in the cockpit in his World War I flying helmet chasing the Red Baron? On closer scrutiny it turns out to be our driver, Tom Van Devanter. He roars on by as two long ropes are unhooked from the tractor and thrown out onto the road behind. Beginning skiers climb aboard the tractor while the old pros shoulder their packs and take a loop in one of the two ropes. Nine-thirty has arrived, and the driver is champing at his microphone to get going. Tail-end Charley radios all clear to start, and with a roar we take off down the road, scattering teenagers into the snow banks like scared chickens.

Somebody halfway up the rope has a loose safety binding, loses his ski, and goes down! This should really make a walloping pig-pile, but no, the tractor has stopped--oh, the wonders of Citizens Band Radio. Now we see why Snoopy wears that WWI flyers helmet-it's got ear phones.

It's every man for himself crossing the Milwaukee tracks while the tractor waits on the other side; then off again, a long double line of brightly colored parkas and packs from which come random puffs of condensed breath. Now and then a snowball is scooped up to land upon an unsuspecting victim.

Soon we cross the bridge, up the slope to a peculiar little structure below the N.P. tracks full of "gas" drums, and affectionately called the "Edifus Wrecks," the end of the line. The driver calls "All out, and don't forget to take up a box of food!" A long nomad migration slowly starts the perilous ascent to the tracks up the "N.P. Icefall." An unfortunate newcomer is seen with two suitcases, a 17-1/2 pound loosely rolled sleeping bag and poles and skis sticking out in all directions from under his arms. He soon learns that a pack is a necessity at Meany and flounders off to the side in knee-deep powder to let the others by.

Finally the lodge. The committee turns on the lights and water, the furnace is stocked with wood, and the girls start heating a large kettle of soup. The work sheet is posted-at Meany all the chores are done by skiers. Taped Austrian yodeling and zither music fill the rapidly warming lodge, as we roast numb toes over the floor furnace and recall our efforts last fall, rolling logs and splitting firewood at the work parties.

* * *

The lodge dates back to 1928, when Mountaineers built it on land purchased and donated by Professor Meany, who among others recognized the necessity of relieving the population explosion at the old [Snoqualmie Lodge](Snoqualmie-Lodge). The new site was a natural, the scouters said, open terrain, good snow at Stampede Pass.

That same year it was ready for winter use--easy access by train made it popular. These were the years-1929-1941-that various races began: the slalom and downhill for men, and the famous ski patrol races between Snoqualmie and Meany hut. Three-man teams, carrying the equivalent of present-day 10 Essentials, plus more, started off at 10-minute intervals over Olallie Meadows, Tinkham Pass, around Mirror Lake, then down Yakima Pass, with a steep climb up to the Cedar River watershed. Then down, over, up, around obstacles till finally, [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill) in view, and the steep lane to the ski hut-average time 5-6 hours.

During the war years and gas rationing, trains made Meany the salvation of skiers until the trains were rescheduled, inconveniencing skiers, and then came the time they no longer stopped at Meany. The new highway over the pass, in spite of the long haul in, is now the only access.

* * *

After hot soup and sandwiches back to the slopes again. And hill packing! "Everyone up as high as you can go, to sidestep the hill" calls the tow chairman over the speaker. To the rousing strains of the Deutschmeister Band, we tramp out long stairstep strips in the broken up hill, with a final sideslip to give a smooth slope.

It's time for a run down [South Slobbovia](South-Slobbovia). From the top of the tow we traverse Green Pastures to Tombstone Canyon, cross to the Bull moose Glacier where some take off for a run down Bullmoose Ridge, but we "druther" cross Druthers Gulch and run Upper South Slobbovia. It's over the edge for a turn in the deep-sheltered powder of Phogbound Gulch, then back into S. Slobbovia for a fast run down the ridge to Brockman's Knob. A hard right turn around [Jacob's Ladder](Jacob's-Ladder) (power-line tower) brings us to wide open skiing over bumps and hollows. We finally cross the bridge over Tombstone Canyon and head back through the woods to the tow.

Daylight wanes, lights go on at the bottom of the hill, and [Lower Slobbovia](Lower-Slobbovia) is abandoned for a few last runs down the lower half of the [Lane](Lane) before dinner.

Dinner, then wash up, do a pot, pay the fees, and be ready to shake a leg to folk dance tapes. Beginners and newcomers are urged to join in and with a little instruction are soon womping out a rollicking "9-Pin Reel" or Schottische with the best of them.

Dorm lights are out at 10 PM to accommodate those who want to survive a Meany day. The hardy, however, continue with dancing until lights blink at 10:45-main floor lights out at 11:00.

Breakfast at 8 AM and out to the slopes. There is the tour to the Stampede Pass weather station or Meany Woods or even to Mt. Baldy. It's good to tramp up through the unbroken snow through the frost covered trees watching the Snoqualmie peaks and Mt. Rainier come into view. A talk with the men at the weather station over a cup of hot coffee affords a well-earned break. These men are unique, as they staff the only winter-manned weather station in our Cascades. Then comes the deep powder run down the power line back to Meany and the yo-yo skiers.

Another skiing day comes to an end. The lodge is put to sleep for another week and packs are shouldered for the hike to the tractor. Beginners climb aboard while the rope-riders take a wild schuss down the road to the bridge. The tow lines are really long now, for everyone who comes in goes out on this one trip. As the procession snakes through the woods, those on the end seldom catch a glimpse of the tractor and Tail-end Charlie has to be assisted by another radio operator in the middle of the line.

Shovels emerge from car trunks and everyone is busy digging out his car and loading gear. It's only 5-1/2 more days till the next trip to Meany.

Sign up with the clubroom secretary (check page 99). Snow tractor for Meany hut leaves parking area 9:30 and 10:30 AM Saturday for lodge; returns to road at 5:30 PM Saturday, and when lodge is closed on Sunday. For details, check with lodge [Chair](Chair).

Junior Mountaineers

In the early fall an overnight backpack and work party is held to clean up one of many areas littered by thoughtless campers and hikers (see photograph, page 40). In 1967 the Junior Mountaineers backpacked from Lake Ozette to the ocean beach at Sandy Point, where they burned and buried debris and cleaned up the camp areas. Later in the year, activities center around the four lodges, with work parties and skiing, culminating in the Ski Carnival in March, usually held at Meany.

Social events aren't overlooked. Meany is also the scene for the Halloween party featuring games and folk dancing. At the Christmas party, usually at a private home, are more games, dancing and refreshments. There are 600 members, about 30 of whom are active. Monthly summer outings-overnight backpacks into the Cascades-are held. Rides and information can be obtained by phoning the clubroom.

Our industrious Meany Hut supporters not only helped at the Rhododendron Preserve, but spent a busy work party season at Meany, their main objective to rebuild the tow. Accomplishments included the installation of a new tow motor, safety gate system, new head pole, commercial power, and re-landscaping of the two lanes and landing area at the bottom of the tow. The lodge kitchen was remodeled, new cupboards were built in the serving and work areas. The outdoor John and Jane were repaired and reroofed to make them serviceable in emergencies. There were, of course, the usual hill clearing, wood gathering and general maintenance chores. Meany has a new brush saw that clears a lot of brush from the hill in a hurry and it was used extensively.

The famous MEANY spirit remained undampened throughout the 1967-68 "ski" season. Lodge utilization was gratifying, in view of poor conditions. The work party season was successful, with an average of 50 people at each session. Parties built an outdoor fire escape, installed a new fire alarm, and brushed the lane, top to bottom, to a maximum height of two inches. These projects were in addition to regular chores of wood gathering, rope-tow and Sno-Tractor repair, and lodge maintenance.

Property Division

The striking feature of the Property Division during this time period was the newness of personnel: three new ski hut chairmen, a new Division chairman, and a sizable number of new hut committee personnel. This group worked many of the same old problems and got involved in some that occasionally gave the Division the appearance of a Mountaineer Crisis Clinic.

In three major areas the Division was fortunate in being able to work closely with State or Federal agencies. It is a refreshing experience to see favorable policy decision at government levels being made in a large part from recommendations, experience and data obtained from The Mountaineers.

The Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission was handed the Snowmobile Control package by the legislative session, and the Mountaineers Property Division arranged to get its representative seated on the ad hoc advisory committee. Our intended purpose was to have an opportunity for input to proposed legislation and to offer plans for snow removal for recreational parking. Our Club ski tours, snowshoe trips, and Meany ski hut attendees were all locking horns (and fenders) with the snowmobile owners over parking and area use. The Mountaineers were able to furnish the State with useful data on number of scheduled trips, average attendance, dates and location of activities, etc. We also assembled a list of roadhead-trailhead use areas of interest to the winter recreationist. State Parks has come up with an excellent snowmobile control legislative package which was presented to the legislature. Adequate snow removal for parking is one prime item explicitly addressed in this report along with stern snowmobile control regulations.

With the completion of I-90 through the Snoqualmie Pass area, the Highway Department terminated all snow removal except for the prime highway. This gave us no parking except at ski areas, from the weighing station at North Bend to Easton. Snowshoe trips and ski tours had to be abandoned because of lack of adequate parking within the snow zone. Meany attendance was badly affected since people could not leave I-90 or park their cars. The Division mobilized a letter campaign to State government and specific Federal agencies. For the winter of 1970-71 there is interim, limited plowing for snow recreation users. The U.S. Forest Service has been extremely cooperative in allowing special areas near I-90 to be plowed specifically for snow players, and has arranged the necessary paperwork for transfer of funds to the specific county snowplowing details.

Regarding long-term use plans at Snoqualmie Pass, there is a serious effort to consolidate the commercial ski operations at the Summit areas, including the gradual urbanization and development of Snoqualmie Pass. The Mountaineers have been consulted about these use plans by the Forest Service both as property owners in the area and as an influential outdoor club. We have made strong and definite recommendations about zoning.

Meany Lodge has been worrying the parking problem for the last ten years. The problem has severely intensified due to the use of the Stampede Pass area by Snowmobiles. In addition, this last winter we have seen a tremendous upsurge of cross country ski tour enthusiasts in the same region. Fortunately, continuous pressure for parking space has been directed at the authorities from many different types of users. The old parking area has been doubled, and funds for snow removal made available from various sources. However, considering the rate of growth of the use of the Stampede Pass region, we must anticipate saturation of these facilities in the near future.

Looking back at the activities of the Division during the year, it is clear that it has been one continuous parking crisis. No other property Division activity has consumed as many man hours and meeting time as the "Parking Problem." It is apparent that any planning for future Mountaineer winter activities and facilities must include serious concern for vehicle parking and costs for snow removal. The Mountaineers must continue to work with both State and Federal agencies in stressing winter access to our public recreational lands. De facto winter closure of many public recreation areas in our mountains now exists due to the official change in snow removal policy. Our continuous pressure on local and federal government has successfully kept a few mountain areas open during the winter.

A major achievement of the work parties at Meany lodge was completion of the new beginner rope tow. Other projects included repainting the main lodge and some outbuildings, replacing the dam for the water system, and completing the water line begun a year ago.

Winter-season attendance at the lodge was good and many new people were introduced to life at Meany, including a number of cross-country skiers. Cross-country has been a growing activity in this area for several years.

At Meany Lodge, the exceptional snowfall allowed the ski season to run from Christmas to May 1. Attendance was good. Members enjoying Meany included skiers, snowshoers, cross country skiers and people just wanting to get away from the city to play in the snow. Cross country skiing continues to be a strong activity at Meany.

A ski school has been started at Meany and is proving to be popular. With the successful advent of the little tow, the ski school will be expanded to include the beginning skier.

The work parties in September, October and November were well attended and productive. A section of the road used by the sno-cat was relocated. The [tow hut](Tow-Hut) was resided and decorated in a Bavarian style.

One of the memories of the Old [Snoqualmie Lodge](Snoqualmie-Lodge) involves the car trip to get there. In 1935 and 1936 going to Snoqualmie Pass wasn't the one hour trip it is today. From Seattle one went around the north or south end of Lake Washington or maybe took the ferry from Madison Park to Kirkland. We lived on Queen Ann Hill and used the northern route via Green Lake, Lake City, Lake Forest Park, Juanita, Kirkland, Redmond, Snoqualmie Falls and finally into North Bend. The coffee stop and meeting place was the North Bend Hotel. When they saw us coming the free crackers and catsup disappeared from the tables. Going on from North Bend was an adventure into the wilderness. The highway went up the hill by the water fall of the South Fork of the Snoqualmie River, past Camp Mason below McClellan's Butte, the Hi Valley gas station and the Bandera emergency airport and on past Denny Creek and Venables Store. It was a real occasion to see a train emerge from or enter the tunnel at Rockdale. Finally, we reached the parking lot across from Lodge Creek. The car was equipped with a locking gas cap and the distributor rotor was removed to help insure that it would be there to get us home again. It was at least a four-hour trip in those days.

The wintertime trip was often longer. Snow would pile up on the two-lane roadway faster than it could be plowed off. The old lodge was probably one of the first ski lodges in the Snoqualmie Pass area. Skiing wasn't the downhill sport it is today. The only way back up was to sidestep or herringbone. Parallel skiing then was cross country. Every year the Snoqualmie skiers would compete with the Meany skiers on a cross-country race between the two Lodges. When Lodge Lake froze over before the snow fell we had ice skating on a natural rink.

The season at Meany Ski Hut started with a washout. The floods before Christmas washed out two bridges on the entrance road, necessitating two hastily called special work parties to repair the road so we could open for the holidays. The same flood washed out the Burlington Northern Railroad bridge at Easton, which was not immediately repaired. Because the railroad tracks were not being plowed, there was no "Ice Fall," and the Sno-cat was able to drive to the door of the lodge on most weekends.

Despite the relatively light snow pack, the skiing was excellent, with only one weekend marred by rain. Every weekend saw capacity crowds, and we welcomed many new skiers to the lodge.

In addition to the excellent skiing and "to the door" service, several other factors helped to bring the crowds and hold them. The new hill packer, christened [Pack Rat](Pack-Rat), turned [Kirkland Park](Kirkland-Park) into a very enjoyable run. The very popular lessons taught by [Patti Polinsky](Patti-Polinsky) and [Dave Claar](Dave-Claar) improved the techniques of beginners and advanced skiers alike. Lessons and "Family Weekend" brought many future juniors. Cross country skiing and snowshoeing were also much in evidence.

A highlight of the season was the Carnival weekend, which featured a "European Feast" complete with bratwurst, German hot potato salad, European pastries and homemade pretzels, in addition to the skiing events-all masterminded by Patti Polinsky. That was the weekend which saw record crowds.

[Ray Nelson](Ray-Nelson) has been Meany chairman for 1O years now and is commencing the first year of what may turn out to be the second decade. The hut operation has prospered under the "Boss's" management and it is very much to the benefit of The Mountaineers, and Meany especially, that Ray is willing to continue.

Fifty years ago a dream came true-Meany Ski Hut was a reality! On Armstice Day, 1 928, Dr. Edmond S. Meany stood with 100 Mountaineers and guests to dedicate a 2-story shelter that had been built by weekend volunteers in two months of back-breaking labor.

To build the hut, club members became carpenters, masons, and pack-horses hauling supplies by hand uphill 300 yards from the Northern Pacific Railroad at Martin to the Meany site. In addition to erecting a 20 x 50' 2-story frame building large enough for 50 people, they made tables and benches, brought in bed springs, mattresses, and other furniture, and even managed to pull a kitchen range weighing 1,700 pounds up the mountain with block and tackle.

Dr. Meany, beloved president of The Mountaineers from 1908 to 1935 and a University of Washington Professor, had purchased for $125 and donated fifty-four acres of the NPRR 1886 construction campsite known as Tunnel City. From 1886-1888, Tunnel City had housed at least 200 construction workers building the two-mile long Stampede Pass Train Tunnel and temporary switchbacks. By 1928, all that existed of Tunnel City and its workshops, warehouses, hospital, restaurant, and saloon was a station house labeled "Martin" and a few employees' cottages. (In the summer of 1964 NPRR destroyed all of its buildings at Martin.)

For several years prior to 1928, Mountaineers on special outings to Stampede Pass had been impressed by the open areas around the present weather station, the power line hill, and the magnificent open timber of [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill). This favorable terrain and the accessibility by train so inspired these explorers that they talked the Mountaineer Board of Trustees into approving "a plain ski shelter without luxurious embellishments" and $1,700 was appropriated for construction. Many materials and supplies for the hut were donated.

Meany Hut still stands a stone's throw from the eastern portal of the Stampede Train Tunnel, on the eastern slope of the Cascades, in the heart of acres of enchantment, almost 3,000 feet above the sea. But how Meany has changed in these last fifty years!-And this is because Meany has been blessed with a steady flow of dedicated volunteers ready to labor mightily.

Skiable areas have been created and two rope tows constructed along with a shelter for rope tow machinery which has been rebuilt several times. A 25x30' 3-story addition to the Ski Hut went up in 1939 and the hut capacity was increased again in 1971. Fire escapes were added to both east and west ends of the hut and the drying room was enlarged and floored with concrete. Numerous other smaller building projects took shape.

Maintaining the equipment has taken an enormous number of volunteer hours. The Bombardier Sno Tractor used to haul skiers from Stampede Overpass to Meany since the trains stopped service in 1960 has needed careful attention as it is Meany's lifeline. The Cat Trail and bridge over Stampede Creek have been rebuilt several times after sections were washed out by flooding. Meany's newest crew member, a Thiokol Spryte Sno-cat which now packs Meany's lower slopes, takes hours of service time.

That's what it has taken to bring Meany through 50 highly successful years!!!

#### Gigantic Birthday Party-Sept 23-24, 1978

On September 23-24, 1978 eight of the original Meany crew and 450 other Mountaineers and guests invaded Meany for a gigantic birthday party to cheer Meany into its next fifty years. The eight early Meanyites were: Gus Hudson, Harriet Taylor Tiedt, Opal Maxwell, Andy and Kay Anderson, Herb and Eugenia Strandberg, and [Fred Ball](Fred-Ball). Highlights of the weekend were the Sunday dedication program and the huge salmon dinner.

Bob Cram masterfully and humorously emceed the dedication program. Royce and Rhea Natoli organized the program agenda, contacted the participants, and arranged for this variety show. Virginia Reid did a tremendous job as overall chairperson for the entire birthday weekend. [Patti Polinsky](Patti-Polinsky) took charge of the elaborate, perfectly-prepared, and very efficiently served salmon dinner.

Wanda Van DeVanter, who supervised registration, reported that Dawn Steere, former Meany woman patrol racer in the 1930's, now living in Orange, California, and Nancy and Trevor Dick and family from Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, probably came from farthest away.

Other facets of the Birthday Weekend were just as outstanding as the Sunday program and Salmon Feed. There were the tours of Meany grounds and ski runs; Coleman Leuthy's mushroom identification treks and lengthy labeled mushroom displays, films of Meany action shown by Bob Bentler, [Doug Damm](Doug-Damm), and Roger Thayer; album and picture exhibits; a Campfire Songfest led by Nancy Adams; folk dancing organized by Arne Svensson with live music by [Art Nation](Art-Nation) and Richard Svensson, and a misty Sunday morning outdoor worship service led by Cadett Barnes.

And now more about that Salmon Dinner which was a lavish Indian-style feast. 174 pounds of fish fillets, turned into delicious outdoor barbecued salmon, were served with herbed brown rice, marinated minted peas, cornbread and honey, coleslaw, and vegetable nibbles with edible apple swans. A huge birthday cake was the dessert. Unbelievably, the entire crowd was fed within 45 minutes.

The enormous birthday cake created by Idona Kellogg caused "oohs" and "ahs" as onlookers read the many signs posted near each miniature scene on the cake. The cake was meant to be a visual presentation of Meany history with the ski runs, rope tows, Hut, railroad tracks, all cut out of cake or built with small ceramics and figurines. Thirty-five one pound cake mixes were used to make the monstrous cake.

For the Sunday Birthday Ceremony, Bob Cram, old-time Meanyite and well-known cartoonist and television personality, hosted a lively hour of laughter and nostalgia as he interviewed past Hut Chairmen about "interesting" events that occurred during their reign.

[Fred Ball](Fred-Ball), an energetic 81-year-old and the 1932 Hut Chairman, entertained the group by singing "Wild Bill Maxwell," a tale written by Art Winder in the 1930's about one of the best-loved and most colorful of Meany's early skiers. Much credit was given to "Max" for organizing the backbreaking labor necessary for building the Hut and clearing the lane. Maxwell's widow, Opal, proudly beamed in the audience as "Max's" story was told in song.

Bob Gram's imitation of "Charlie's" jungle noises in the men's dorm had the crowd roaring. As Cram said, "He had no rhythm to his snoring."

[Bill Brockman](Bill-Brockman), 1953 Hut Chairman, told of some of the technical problems of getting highly-esteemed, over-weight "Nashie," the cook, up the hill each weekend. She prepared the meals at Meany for twenty nine years, from 1935 to 1964. [Peggy Grass](Peggy-Grass) has been our ingenious cook for the last eleven years.

"Times were really gloomy at Meany in early 1960," [Doug Damm](Doug-Damm), Hut Chairman at that time, recounted. "The trains stopped in March, 1960 and the rest of that season supplies had to be hand-carried all the way from the highway." Doug hilariously told the story of a test run behind Tom Van DeVanter's station wagon to determine how people would react to being towed in by the Cat on ropes. Apparently after a speedy start, a little panic, and a frantic call to "STOP," Tom applied the brakes and the skiers all plowed into his open tailgate.

Bob Cram said this of Walter Little, who has skied Meany for forty of its fifty years: " Walt was a pioneer in ski technique. Anything that was crazy Walt had already tried." Besides his many technical contributions Walt concocted many of the names around [Meany Hill](Meany-Hill) like "Psychopath" and "Lower Slobbovia". Walt, with his keen intellect, has helped create the friendly and witty Meany atmosphere.

Mountaineers President Jim Sanford, after giving some warm welcoming remarks, had his turn at story-telling as he introduced present Hut Chairman, [Ray Nelson](Ray-Nelson). Ray has served for twelve years.

Many others contributed to the program. Art Nation fiddled as dancers spun out the nine-pin reel. Steve Stout sang "In the Mountains," a song he'd just written. The "Impoverished Players" portrayed by three skits 1) the Erection of Meany Hut, 2) Life at the present day Hut, and 3) Meany of the year 2023, with skiers arriving by airbus and being served by a robot.

The technical details were carried out with incredible smoothness. There was not a traffic problem anywhere in spite of the number of cars maneuvering those narrow mountain roads. Camping, fire, water, garbage, and sewer facilities had been carefully planned for. Even the problem of getting the heavy dining room tables from inside the lodge to the grounds took ingenuity. A stage was built and straw bales brought in. Much work was done to prepare the lodge and immediate grounds.

The Birthday Weekend was another prime example of what can be accomplished by dedicated, hard-working, and determined volunteers. May that caliber of volunteer be with Meany for the next fifty years!

It all began at Meany Ski Hut this season with preparation for the Meany 50th Birthday Party, Sept. 23-24. This turned out to be an exceptionally well-organized spectacular event with 450 participants.

A highlight of the ski season was the carnival weekend which featured many corny contests and crazy races, a clowns contest, and a "European Feast" complete with German hot potato salad and homemade European pastries, pretzels, and breadsticks. Many fancy relish trays with elaborate flowered vegetable "nibblies" and apple swans served from an outdoor snow table is an example of how embellished and painstaking the carnival events were. This fantastic weekend was masterminded by [Patti Polinsky](Patti-Polinsky).

One extra special Saturday night program was the dedication banquet for [Walter's Woods](Walter's-Woods) with Master of Ceremonies [Lee Helser](Lee-Helser) cleverly spicing the evening and a film on Walter shown by Bob Bentler. A huge cake shaped like a bald head contained a hidden cavity which was opened to reveal Walter's thoughts in the form of sayings on heart-shaped candies.

A very important change to the Meany vicinity was made in the summer of 1978 when the Forest Service logged Section 34 which included "Henrietta's Woods" and "No-Name-Woods." These areas are now known as "Henrietta's Meadow" and "Walter's Woods." The gulley between the two has been christened "RBCSA Gulch" and the cross-country ski trail labeled "Al's Fringe." (RBCSA means Retroactive Birth Control Society of America.)

In September 1978 a gigantic Wolf gas kitchen range with two large ovens was somehow hauled into Meany's kitchen.

Great things have been happening at Meany Ski Hut. For the first time ever a marriage took place at Meany as Georgean and Dick Curran skied to their wedding at the top of kitchen run. Following the ceremony the minister skied the hill with the rest of the wedding party. A huge seven-part cake made by Idona Kellogg was brought in sections and assembled at the lodge. The reception began with a march of the newly-weds through arched ski poles.

Record crowds were drawn to Meany this season by outstanding live music, vigorous folk dancing, huge home-made ice cream parties, fantastic skiing, terrific ski lessons by Patti and [Dave Claar](Dave-Claar) and Glen Polinsky, entertaining plays and programs, and world encompassing movies and slide shows.

Special thanks go to musicians Richard Swensson, [Art Nation](Art-Nation), Lyle Schaefer, Frank Gilbert, Jim Noyes, Roy Wagner, Olemara Peters, and the Speldosan Group. Also the Mountaineer Players presented three delightful performances: The Story Theatre, Who Murdered Who, and a musical review, F.M. at P.M. Thanks also to Jack Reid and Michael Clarke who did great jobs with their slide shows of recent trips.

Alaska Weekend went over big with a greased pole contest, a gorp presentation, Alaska slides by [Paul Bergman](Paul-Bergman) and movies by [Bob Bentler](Bob-Bentler), a reading by Royce Natoli of Robert Service's <i>Iceworm Cocktail</i>, and refreshments of ice worms and Ghosttown Sourdough Cookies. That's enough to turn anybody into a "blooming bonafide sourdough."

Another notable weekend was the Leap Day Bonanza where Hilde garde Hamhocker of Tumbleweeds (played by Bob Bentler) and Sadie Hawkins from Dogpatch (portrayed by [Norm Vigus](Norm-Vigus)) invaded Meany to choose a mate from among the many Meany eligibles. Other skit characters were the minister ([Dave Claar](Dave-Claar)) and the victim (Charlie Vail). [Walter Little](Walter-Little) walked away with the Bachelor of the Year Award with Norm Vigus as runner-up. Bob Bentler showed Super 8 movies of Walt and Norm to prove why they should be the winners.

The Annual Spring Carnival was again a superb event as master minded by [Patti Polinsky](Patti-Polinsky). In addition to skiing events there were corny contests and crazy races, a clowns contest, and a "European Feast" complete with German hot potato salad and homemade European pastries, pretzels, and breadsticks.

Meany work parties installed a second hot water tank, painted the "cats," and started the enormous task of clearing [Walter's Woods](Walter's-Woods) and [Henrietta's Meadow](Henrietta's-Meadow), in addition to the usual fall maintenance and upkeep.

After long negotiations with the railroad we gained final approval and installed a gate below the railroad to help cut down on vandalism.

Meany Ski Hut started with a strong work party season; in other words, there was a packed lodge each weekend and abundant willing workers. The ski season looked promising as there appeared to be a zooming interest in Meany shown by many newcomers and old timers alike. All expectations were washed away by rain and lack of snow. However, the few weekends Meany did open the skiing was superb.

The work party season was very productive. A tool shed was built to house tractor parts. The study area was moved from the end of the Third Person's Dorm to a small area taken off the Women's Dorm. Bunks were added to the former study room so that Meany's sleeping capacity remains the same.

New tracks were put on the Bombardier and many modifications were made to the Thiokol. In short, the Thiokol was stripped and repainted; a new shift linkage was installed; a new instrument panel was fabricated; and a new transmission was added. All of this required much creative adaptation of the whole Thiokol system by some brilliant minds.

Concrete steps were poured near the kitchen door and a concrete sidewalk was put in from the front steps to the basement.

In addition to the usual fall maintenance and upkeep, much of the hill was brushed this season and a new bridge was placed across Tombstone Canyon.

With all ready and waiting, Meany Ski Hut anticipates a super season for the year to come.

(In order to have the lodge reports reflect the skiing season, rather than the chronological year, most lodges will present their winter of 1980-1981 reports in next year's annual.)


## [1981](https://www.mountaineers.org/about/history/the-mountaineer-annuals/indexes-annuals-maps/the-mountaineer-1981)

p. 156

Winter 1981 ski season was washed away by rain, but Meany Ski Hut did manage to open in February and March for a few weekends of skiing on new fallen but sparse snow. The Meany [tow hut](Tow-Hut) log shows the "mach" (speed of sound) tow was operated for only fifty hours in 1981. By the time this article was written on Jan. 10, 1982, the 1982 ski season had already used the "mach" tow for sixty hours.

Since the 1980 Meany work party season had been so productive (see July, 1981 Mountaineer Annual for accomplishments), the Meany 1981 Fall work party season found much ready and waiting for a good snow. However, the list of 1981 achievements is still impressive.

Crews built a power line from Puget Sound Power line on [Lower Slobbovia](Lower-Slobbovia) to the lodge. This became necessary because last year a tree took out a power line and during the process of repair Burlington-Northern management discovered Meany Ski Hut was still getting power from the railroad. The power permit was cancelled but Burlington-Northern continued to supply power to the lodge during spring and summer of 1981 and until Meany could connect to Puget Sound Power. Thank you, Burlington-Northern! And thanks to Carsten Lien for negotiating this arrangement.

Also during fall, 1981, the Meany "in-house" telephone system was restored. Bell telephone connections were repaired too. The shed to house tractor parts was completed. Some of the poles for the "mach" and "worm" tows were replaced. The bridge over Stampede Creek was rebuilt where an abutment had washed out. The culvert at Weasel Creek was cleaned out so it is no longer necessary to cover it with a log bridge which always had to be removed after the snows melted.

On the light side, Al Alleman and Kent Nelson, amid great applause, were awarded the "Order of the Mole - Second Class" for excavating the three foot diameter by thirty foot long culvert of Weasel Creek which had collected debris for over four years. These two heroes were told that if they wished to try for "Order of the Mole - First Class" they would have to dig a longer hole.

Work party-goers were treated to lively evenings at the hut with lots of folk dancing, a Halloween party, a steak feed, and ski movies.

From Christmas, 1981 to New Years, 1982, Meany was well attended and blessed with absolutely super snow. Although the entire week was filled with activities both on the hill and in the hut, the New Year's Eve festivities were notable. It all started when the "Advanced Emissary of the New Year's Baby," [Walter Little](Walter-Little), appeared. This messenger introduced the new year with a "make it-yourself" Pizza Party and a magnificent Torchlight Parade. Creative and unusual pizzas emerged quickly from the dozens of pizza fixings furnished, but the spectacular Torchlight Parade stole the show. Brian Johnson organized this remarkable serpentine of twenty torchbearers and assembled them at the top of the ski hill at 11:55. Slowly the group wound their way to the bottom of the hill and planted the torches in a figure "2" near the bonfire. There amidst jubilation and singing, the new year arrived. All who wished skied the lighted hill from 11 p.m. till 12:30.

Other 1981 newsworthy events:

* Over a hundred Meany Hut enthusiasts met at Gasworks Park for an August potluck and reunion.
* An Indiana man, Tom McCart, won the "Uno Championship" at Meany over Christmas. This Great Northwest visitor also came the longest distance to get to Meany: over 2,000 miles.

Record crowds were drawn to Meany Ski Hut this season by plentiful snow, fantastic skiing, terrific ski lessons with capacity classes taught by [Patti Polinsky](Patti-Polinsky), Dave Claar and Kim Nelson, vigorous folk dancing, extremely talented musicians, and entertaining skits and programs.

One of the biggest 1982 thrills was Dick Curran's 50 ft. aerial ride which was the last leg of an obstacle course he set up for the Spring Carnival. The Spring Carnival had an Austrian flavor as Patti Claar masterminded "zillertal" activities. This enormous undertaking included a hill-wide scavenger hunt, snow golfing, bow and arrow rivalry, a bean carry, slow slalom course, frisbee toss, snake follow, inner tube run, kids' costume parade, an authentic Austrian dinner, a huge "Konditorei" pastry table, a lavish luncheon complete with fancy vegetable nibblies and homemade breadsticks and pretzels, and a "lively" folkdance stimulated by Meany's gifted musicians.

The proportion of cross-country skiers using Meany Hut continues to increase. Al Alleman graciously donates time and expertise to show people the fabulous ski trails in Meany vicinity. During work party season Al's crew labors to improve these trails.

During work party season, Meany women took charge of the "Ox" and the two hill "brush" saws. Thanks to the gals the whole lane from top to bottom has been brushed. This took two years to do but the entire lane is now skiable on six inches of snow! The ladies on the "Ox" lifted and hauled firewood, propane tanks, giant pumpkins, dozens of mattresses, Cat ski boxes, tractor treads, brush, garbage, you name it. Meanwhile, Meany men overhauled both tractors.

The list of accomplishments during work party season is impressive. New mattresses were hauled in and mattress covers sewn. The study was paneled. Ray Nelson made two wooden couches and a bench for Meany's basement. The entire Meany basement was remodeled adding several new drying areas and a first aid facility. The Bombardier was refurbished with new paint, new canvas, new upholstery, and gorgeous Scandinavian designs on the ski boxes. In addition to "flowering" the ski boxes, Georgean Curran "rosemaled" the picture boards for Meany walls.

A cross-country ski bridge was built by the railroad tunnel. The Cat road to the lodge was straightened. A Gas House was added to the [Tow Hut](Tow-Hut). A new communications system was initiated. The Generator Hut received some carpentry. The pantry was rigged with wire mesh. Logs were winched off North. The trail from Walter's Woods to North was regraded. The bridge at the bottom of Tombstone Canyon was improved.

Meany Ski Lodge continues to operate their downhill rope tows, and in fact, has added a beginner tow. Here too, more and more downhill skiers are sharing the slopes with the cross-country skiers heading out on tours in the backcountry or practicing their telemarks.

Meany still runs a very busy downhill ski school through January and February and has added a cross country session as well. In addition, they offer clinics for telemarking as often as possible during the season.

Another innovation at Meany has been the introduction of MOFA classes. The entire MOFA course, practical exam and CPR are offered during two very full weekends at the lodge. Students have given the class rave reviews and seem to appreciate the chance to have their practicals in such a remote and realistic location.

Meany Ski Hut, built on land donated by President Meany at Martin, was dedicated in 1928. Easy access by train from Seattle at a cost of $1.80 round trip and our own coach in which to play games and even dance if there were 15 or more passengers made it so popular that in 1939 a new 3-story addition, 24x30', was added under the chairmanship of Jack Hossack. Hundreds of volunteer hours were given. Being among the less talented, I was sent up on the roof to help with shingling, while other more experienced and artistic members such as Boyd Bucey designed and constructed the interior decor, including scalloped wooden valances over the windows and silhouettes of fir trees cut out of the shutters. The new addition included a basement with furnace in place of the former pot-bellied stove in the middle of the living room, drying and waxing rooms and best of all-at long last-indoor plumbing!

The most isolated of the properties, Meany Lodge increased its service to The Mountaineers by hosting Murder Mystery Weekends (including one for our singles which filled up all 65 of its slots within two hours), [MOFA](MOFA) weekend training sessions, [Mountain Bike Workshops](Mountain-Bike-Workshops), [Rail Road Buff](Railroad-Buffs) gatherings, and the ever-popular [Wild Mushroom Hunt](Mushroom-Weekend). Of course, the [Ski School](Ski-School) and our telemark weekends are as popular as ever.

The major project completed was the excavation of about a fourth of the basement and the construction of a new classroom in its place.

The Singles Committee initiated a number of new activities in 1993 and 1994. These included horseback riding, a sleigh ride, biking in the San Juans, and regular pot luck evenings. Games night, volleyball, tennis and slide shows continued co be very popular. Another Mystery Weekend at Meany Lodge took place, in expanded form.
