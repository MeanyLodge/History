### History

#### 1928

The kitchen was at the east end. Coal was used in a big 1,700 pound hotel kitchen range that was hauled up the hill with block and tackle.<sup>[ma56][], [ma78][], [hw][]</sup>

#### 1939

Kitchen moved to west end.<sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1949

Installed new propane range in kitchen. This replaced coal-fired range upon which 25 years of cooks have suffered.<sup>[ma78][], [hw][]</sup>

#### 1978

In September 1978 a gigantic Wolf gas kitchen range with two large ovens was somehow hauled into Meany's kitchen.<sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1987

Revise kitchen, added fire prevention sheeting, revise plumbing, move range from west wall to south wall, moved hot water tanks to under counter.<sup>[hw][]</sup>

A major remodeling of the Meany kitchen was started at the July weeklong work party and finished this fall. New cupboards and counter spaces were built. The huge cook stove was relocated on the window side of the kitchen. Another window was built. With the two windows and an added ventilation system, Meany's kitchen air is much sweeter, less humid, and more temperate.<sup>[hr][]</sup>

Crews redid the plumbing for the new sinks and relocated the water heaters. Ray Nelson fabricated an extensive copper tubing utensil rack above the kitchen island and shaped the soap rack above the new sinks.

#### 2011

Range hood was installed around 2007, it was after Amy and I were regulars (after the Snoqualmie hut burned) <sup>[gs][]</sup>

<hr>

The range hood was installed in October/November 2011. Attached is a picture of it after installation. In July/August 2012 ( per my WP report) the seniors added to the hood the lights and thermal override relay to cut the fan out in case of fire.

The fire suppression system is supposed to be service each year by a qualified technician just like the fire extinguishers. To my knowledge I do not believe it has been serviced since it was installed. Also the hood and fan need to be cleaned of grease each year which has been done at times.<sup>Ray Nelson, 2022-01-25 email</sup>

<hr>
- Amerex PRM Kitchen unit
- Has Manual Pull Station, Heat Detector, Gas Shut Off Valve
- The grease caps that Matt identified are installed ( I remember A) looking at them and going “urgh! They look really greasy” and B) I wonder if they are meant to be removed to allow the system to work)
- Is now integrated into the Fire Alarm system
- The Nitrogen bottle (i.e. the physical force, not the wet chem bottle) has a pressure gauge which is unreadable (cover screen is completely opaque)
- There is no safety sticker that I could see saying “re-test by” or similar
- The Amerex manual asks for six monthly service from one of their reps (!!!), monthly checks on a number of obvious physical things (nozzle condition, pressure, release mechanisms, etc.) and REGULAR (hint, hint!) Hood & Duct de-greasing.
