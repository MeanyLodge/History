### History

#### 1928

Ernest's committee selected the Martin site and Dr. Edmond S Meany purchased it and donated it to the Mountaineers. Generous donations were made by the Everett and Tacoma branches. Materials were shipped by rail to Martin, unloaded by the enthusiastic volunteer workers and carried uphill 300 yards <sup>[ma78][]</sup> to the site by hand. Construction was started in September and dedicated on November 11.

Meany Ski Hut opened for skiing in the winter of 1928/29.

A frame building. One enters the front door and discovers a long, well lit spacious room with easy staircases running up either end to dorms on the second story. An open kitchen at the far side, tables and benches sprawl about the room and canvas-back easy chairs invite one to sit near the round-bellied heating stove. The lofty dorms have 52 spring double decker bunks and new mattresses. There are sinks with hot running water, mirrors aplenty and hooks to one's heart's content.<sup>[hut][]</sup>

outside 2-holers for Jane and John. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1930

Added pantry to West end - 8'X20', one story, lean-to roof. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1939

Put finish flooring and inside lining in both new addition and old hut building. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

This summer it has been work, a total of 350 working weekends to build the fine 3-story, 24x30' addition on the east end. The hut has a large basement housing a furnace, drying room, waxing room and wash rooms.<sup>[ma39][]</sup>

Moved kitchen to west end. Added motor-generator set for electric lights. Added new furnace; and inside plumbing. Added wiring for electric lights in hut, replacing gasoline lanterns.<sup>[ma78][]</sup>

Being among the less talented, I was sent up on the roof to help with shingling, while other more experienced and artistic members such as Boyd Bucey designed and constructed the interior decor, including scalloped wooden valances over the windows and silhouettes of fir trees cut out of the shutters. The new addition included a basement with furnace in place of the former pot-bellied stove in the middle of the living room, drying and waxing rooms and best of all-at long last-indoor plumbing!<sup>[ma91][]</sup>
