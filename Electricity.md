### History

#### 1939

Added gasoline motor-generator set for electric lights. Added wiring for electric lights in hut, replacing gasoline lanterns. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1946

By the time the first snowflake falls on the [Lane](/Run/Lane), Meany will boast a new light plant<sup>[ma46][]</sup>

#### 1960

Three different second-hand light plants have been used at Meany for lights since 1939. All of them ran! Meany has never been without lights.
- The Meany Lane is now lighted at night. Lights at top and bottom are produced by second-hand generators and voltage regulators attached to the rope; those in the center by a gasoline-electric generator known as the "turbo-encabulator." All equipment was bought at junk prices. No failures yet! <sup>[tp][]</sup>

#### 1963

Construction of a power line from the Martin Station on the Northern Pacific Railroad tracks to the Hut was started after an agreement had been consummated with the railroad for power. Mountaineers built 600' of 2400 V single phase power line to R.R. terminus; kept motor-generator set as standby. <sup>[ma63][] [ma78][] [hw][]</sup>

Commercial power first came to the Lodge in the early ‘60s via the BN railroad at (RR) 2400 volt.  The power came from the vicinity of the RR tunnel and ran to the Lodge on a Mountaineer installed and maintained power line. The power cost a flat rate of $35/year and there was no meter. The load limit was 5 kW which we quickly exceeded and then also picked up the tow hut and later the Zoo/Cat House loads.<sup>[rn19][]</sup>

## 1980

Power connection to BNRR interrupted by falling tree. Connection restored temporarily, but BNRR advises their power line over Stampede Pass is to be abandoned. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1981

Constructed power transmisison to connect Meany system to Puget Sound Power Line on South side of Meany property. \~500 ft. Transformers to convert supply at 7000v to 240v. Meter at point of tie to supply line. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

This (the 1980 power outage) resulted in converting our electrical load to PSE in the summer of 1981 by building a power line from the BPA transmission line right of way to the Lodge. PSE had a 7200-volt line on the BPA R/W. A primary meter (7200 Volt) was needed because of the distance to the lodge and the distributed loads that we had.<sup>[rn19][]</sup>

#### 1982

Crews built a power line from Puget Sound Power line on [Lower Slobbovia](/Run/Lower-Slobbovia) to the lodge. This became necessary because last year a tree took out a power line and during the process of repair Burlington-Northern management discovered Meany Ski Hut was still getting power from the railroad. The power permit was cancelled but Burlington-Northern continued to supply power to the lodge during spring and summer of 1981 and until Meany could connect to Puget Sound Power. Thank you, Burlington-Northern! And thanks to [Carsten Lien](/Person/Carsten-Lien) for negotiating this arrangement. <sup>[ma82][]</sup>

#### 1985

Rewire all basement electric circuits all of which were overloaded. Installed new electric control panels and switches in pantry. Power supply to [Cat House](/Building/Cat-House) put underground. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1986

- Add dead end hardware on trees supporting power line between lodge and tows <sup>[hw][]</sup>
- Disconnects added at power pole at [Mach](/Mach) tow
- Power lines were revised to include dead end hardware at all trees. <sup>[hr][]</sup>


#### 2005

PSE meter was swapped out.<sup>[rn19][]</sup>


#### 2006

A PSE meter changeout resulted in a metering errors and an assignment to Rate Schedule 25 because the indication was that we exceeded the 50-kW limit (still low voltage service but with a demand charge added). A billing dispute took place at this point which we finally prevailed with a $13,000 plus rebate and movement back to Rate Schedule 24 where we are today.  Sometime after the billing dispute was settled PSE turned off the recording of the demand function at the meter and it is still off today but could be restored, at any time, most likely remotely from their office.<sup>[rn19][]</sup>


#### 2013

Add the 50 HP motor load to the system by replacing the gas motor in the Tow Hut with the electric motor at the State Inspector’s insistence.  Load studies were done and actions to reduce loads were taken. <sup>[rn19][]</sup>


#### 2015

The old power poles were rotted off. L-boz Construction in Ellensburg replaced the entire power line from PSE to the lodge. $21,692. <sup>[rn19][], [rn15][] </sup>

Repair power line between poles 1-2. 3-men, 6 hr on snowmobiles. L-Boz
construction: $2,083.41.


#### 2016

Power line repair by L-boz Construction on January 9th. Repair 1 span west of the Tow Hut for $1601.71.<sup>[rn19][]</sup>


#### 2017

Jack Sansaver of L-boz Construction in Ellensburg replaced a fuse on a transformer. "Looks like animal got into high side." $200. <sup>[rn19][]</sup>


#### 2021

A downed tree took out our power line between poles 1 and 2. See [Power Outage Nov 2021](https://github.com/MeanyLodge/Committee/issues/18)
