### History

#### 1928

Established "continuous community domestic supply for a lodge" from [Tombstone Creek](/Tombstone-Creek). Priority date: June 30, 1889.

Water piped in from nearby creek. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

The original pipe line was iron (you can still some remnants of it in the
road up to the Lane) was installed in approximately 1928 which lasted months
(froze in the first winter and split).  It was replaced shortly there after
and lasted until the early '80. <sup>[rn][]</sup>

#### 1939

water supply line changed to enter new basement. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1955

The water supply dam which BPA built to replace the original dam was defective. Meany troops built new dam for which BPA paid. <sup>[ma78][], [hw][]</sup>

#### 1972

Water supply line changed 500' of 1Â¼" black iron pipe to 2" plastic. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1974

Replaced water supply dam in [Tombstone Creek](Tombstone-Creek). Complete replacement of old black iron 1-1/4" pipe with 2" plastic. Water supply line is now 500' of 2" galvanized steel and 1,132' of 2" plastic. <sup>[ma78][], [hw][]</sup>

#### 1978

Improved plumbing and shut-off valves where supply line enters basement under hatch in men's toilet. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1979

Add electric water heater: existing propane fueled water heater insufficient capacity. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1987

Revise kitchen, revise plumbing, moved hot water tanks to under counter. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1993-2003

Place two storage tanks near the dam and replace the existing iron pipe with 2" PVC from the dam to approximately midway between North and Kirkland Park. <sup>[rn][]</sup>

#### 2007

Replace the pipe from Kirkland Park to the Lodge with 2" PVC with shut off valves near the connection point. <sup>[rn][]</sup>

#### ????

Switched to propane water heaters located in the pantry.

#### 2019

Sank a new well, because the Kittitas County Health Department compelled us to. Dam water is still being used for flushing toilets and fire suppression system. Built the [Pump House](/Building/Pump-House) to enclose the well head.

#### 2020

Cleaned the dam prefilter. [Michael Moreland](/Person/Michael-Moreland) and Lucas Simerson climbed into the reservoir with 5 gallon buckets and scooped out 10 gallons of sediment. A further flushing was made by opening the valve in Kirkland Park and stirring up the sediment while water was flowing through.

#### 2023

The [WA Dept. Of Health](https://doh.wa.gov/) has upgraded us from a Group B to a [Group A TNC](https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/drinking-water/water-system-assistance/tnc-water-systems) water facility. In practical terms, the significant changes are:

    from: reporting to our local AHJ (Kittitas County)
    to: reporting directly to the WA DOH.

    from: testing nitrates every 3 years
    to: testing annually

    from: testing coliform in Jan & March
    to: testing in Jan, Feb, Mar, Jun, Jul, Aug, Oct, Dec

Meany Lodge must collect water samples and deliver them directly to a testing lab. Meany's
WFI System Id is
[AE187H](https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/eh/portal/odw/si/SingleSystemViews/GenInfoSingleSys.aspx?OrgNum=AE187H&xid=110022&OrgName=Meany+Lodge). It can also be found on the [Water System Search](https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/eh/portal/odw/si/FindWaterSystem.aspx) page using our <i>Owner Name</i> of `Meany Lodge`.

The state publishes a [complete list of all the testing labs](https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/laboratorysearch/SearchLabName.aspx) in the state. One of them is the [Seattle-King Co Dept of Public Health Lab](https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/laboratorysearch/SearchLabName.aspx?CompanyID=503) which accepts commercial / public samples in the basement of Harborview hospital. They can do our coliform testing for $25.

For Nitrate testing in Seattle, there a couple options including [Fremont Analytical](https://www.fremontanalytical.com/).
