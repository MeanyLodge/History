# Yellow Rock
### Location

Semi-cliff in [Soffreenia Wood](/Run/Soffreenia-Wood).

### Origin

Steep short pitches off this are character testing. Frequent refusals to accept the challenge created the name and fame. As Rolf said, "Yellow Rock before you go off, Brown Rock after you go off." <sup>[nw][]</sup>
