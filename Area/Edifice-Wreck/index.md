### History
#### 1960

Built in 1960 by some students who at the time were working their way through the Greek classic tragedy <i>Oedipus Rex</i>. Forgive them the pun - even a little humor is better than none. <sup>[nw][]</sup>

#### 1961

Construct [Edifus Wreck](Edifus-Wreck) below RR track to serve as gas station for snow tractor. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1968

Soon we cross the bridge, up the slope to a peculiar little structure below the N.P. tracks full of "gas" drums, and affectionately called Edifus Wrecks, the end of the line. The driver calls "All out, and don't forget to take up a box of food!" A long nomad migration slowly starts the perilous ascent to the tracks up the "N.P. Icefall." <sup>[ma68][]</sup>

#### 1979

Abandoned when it became possible to run [Tom Cat](Tomcat) over the BNRR to the [Lodge](Lodge).

#### 2020

It's name fits now more than ever.
