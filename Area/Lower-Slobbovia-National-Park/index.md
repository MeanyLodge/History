### Location

The center of [Lower Slobbovia](/Run/Lower-Slobbovia).

### Origin

This was a small lone hemlock, branches on one side only, that lived for a while in the center of [Lower Slobbovia](/Run/Lower-Slobbovia). After Senator Phogbound - at a special hearing - had this declared a national park, it was cherished and guarded. Signs appeared;

- "Keep Slobbovia Green - bring money."
- "Keep off."
- "No dogs allowed."

It finally fell down one winter. <sup>[nw][]</sup>
