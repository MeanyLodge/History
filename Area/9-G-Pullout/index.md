# 9-G Pullout
### Location

A very steep slope from [Brockman's Knob](/Area/Brockman's-Knob) straight down to the [Water](/Water) supply. <sup>[nw][]</sup>

### Origin

When snow is deep, the trick is to run this absolutely straight, until at the last minute a turn is made down the canyon. The centrifugal acceleration force in this turn is estimated at 9-G's. Those who fail to turn make a tunnel into the opposite bank under [North Slobbovia](/Run/North-Slobbovia). 9 G's - 9 guys, this is, were required to extract tunnel builders. <sup>[nw][]</sup>
