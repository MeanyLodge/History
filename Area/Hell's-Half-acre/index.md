This patch of ground is north of the [Lane](Lane) and south of [Cognito Wood](Cognito-Wood). It was logged by NPRR in 1886 and in 1928 there was second growth brush and timber on it. <sup>[nw][]</sup>

In about 1930, Mountaineers cleared the brush and second growth to get some open skiing near the hut. The work was done in exceptionally hot weather, becoming known as "Hell's Half-acre." <sup>[hw][]</sup>
