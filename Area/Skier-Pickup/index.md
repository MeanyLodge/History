# Skier Pickup
### Location

The low point on F.S. Road 420, where downhill skiers that depart Meany come to a sad stop. When leaving the lodge, it's just past [Stampede Creek](Stampede-Creek). <sup>[matt][]</sup>

### Origin

So named because downhill skiers stop there and wait for [Tomcat](/Machine/Tomcat) or a snowmobile to stop and throw out a rope for them. <sup>[matt][]</sup>
