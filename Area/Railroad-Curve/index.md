# Railroad Curve
### Location

A sharp curve to the right on the old [Downhill Trail](/Run/Downhill-Trail).<sup>[nw][]</sup>

### Origin

From this sharp curve a skier could stop and look directly down on the old Martin RR station. If you didn't make it around the curve, you had a good chance of landing on the "railroad."<sup>[nw][]</sup>
