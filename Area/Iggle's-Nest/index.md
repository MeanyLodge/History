# Iggle's Nest
### Location

A rocky lump on the side of [North Slobbovia](/Run/North-Slobbovia).

### Origin

It was named for the Lower Slobbovian "Iggle," a creature with a large blue head, no feathers, no body, two large clawed feet, that somehow can fly anyway. <sup>[nw][]</sup>

There was a creature in Al Capps L'il Abner cartoon strip that had one foot, a blue head and no body. It only grows in the country of [Lower Slobbovia](/Run/Lower-Slobbovia). The Lower Slobbovians were like Meany people - they wore ratty clothes and lived in snow holes. Ferguson used the Iggle's Nest for a jump takeoff and got 40-50 ft of air. <sup>[n9][]</sup>
