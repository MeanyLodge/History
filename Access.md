### History

#### 1928

The Sunset Highway wasn't regularly open during the winter so the Northern Pacific Railroad was the primary means of access.

#### 1929

The ride to Meany via the Northern Pacific passenger train cost $2 round trip. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### late 1930s

Snoqualmie Pass was plowed more regularly and some skiers would park at the Rustic Inn on the Sunset Highway (present day I-90) and ski to the lodge.

#### 1939

Access continues to be passenger trains on NPRR. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1960

In April of 1960, NPRR discontinued passenger service to Martin. <sup>[ma60][]</sup> Meany leased a Bombardier snow tractor [Tomcat](Tomcat),-to haul gear and tow skiers from I-90 to [Edifice Wreck](Edifice-Wreck). <sup>[hw][]</sup>

The Meany Committee was authorized to negotiate a lease for the use of a snow tractor during the 1960-61 ski season. <sup>[ma60][]</sup> After 31 years of access by train, Meany must now find another way. Will Meany Survive? October: Rental agreement with Symington for use of Bombardier Sno Tractor to haul skiers from Snoqualmie Pass Highway across valley to Meany-3 miles. <sup>[ma78][]</sup>

#### 1961

Access to Meany is by automobile to highway highway overpass near Rustic Inn, exit 62. Cars park on overpass ramps, from thence snow tractor conveys skiers to Meany. Some ride on tractor, most ride their skis and are towed behind the tractor. [Tom Cat](Tomcat) hauled max load of 82 skiers. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1966

Widened the road above the NPRR tracks to the hut to permit vehicle access. <sup>[ma66][], [hw][]</sup>

#### 1968

During the war years and gas rationing, trains made Meany the salvation of skiers until the trains were rescheduled, inconveniencing skiers, and then came the time they no longer stopped at Meany. The new highway over the pass, in spite of the long haul in, is now the only access. <sup>[ma68][]</sup>

Dickinson starts a snowmobile rental operation near Milwaukee RR Crossing and plows access road to his operation. For $200 he also plows parking for Meany near Milwaukee tracks. Ceased operations in 1969. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

One of the memories of the Old [Snoqualmie Lodge](Snoqualmie-Lodge) involves the car trip to get there. In 1935 and 1936 going to Snoqualmie Pass wasn't the one hour trip it is today. From Seattle one went around the north or south end of Lake Washington or maybe took the ferry from Madison Park to Kirkland. We lived on Queen Ann Hill and used the northern route via Green Lake, Lake City, Lake Forest Park, Juanita, Kirkland, Redmond, Snoqualmie Falls and finally into North Bend. The coffee stop and meeting place was the North Bend Hotel. When they saw us coming the free crackers and catsup disappeared from the tables. Going on from North Bend was an adventure into the wilderness. The highway went up the hill by the water fall of the South Fork of the Snoqualmie River, past Camp Mason below McClellan's Butte, the Hi Valley gas station and the Bandera emergency airport and on past Denny Creek and Venables Store. It was a real occasion to see a train emerge from or enter the tunnel at Rockdale. Finally, we reached the parking lot across from Lodge Creek. The car was equipped with a locking gas cap and the distributor rotor was removed to help insure that it would be there to get us home again. It was at least a four-hour trip in those days. <sup>[ma76][]</sup>

The wintertime trip was often longer. Snow would pile up on the two-lane roadway faster than it could be plowed off. The old lodge was probably one of the first ski lodges in the Snoqualmie Pass area. Skiing wasn't the downhill sport it is today. The only way back up was to sidestep or herringbone. Parallel skiing then was cross country. Every year the Snoqualmie skiers would compete with the Meany skiers on a cross-country race between the two Lodges. When Lodge Lake froze over before the snow fell we had ice skating on a natural rink.

#### 1977

The same flood washed out the Burlington Northern Railroad bridge at Easton, which was not immediately repaired. Because the railroad tracks were not being plowed, there was no "Ice Fall," and the Sno-cat was able to drive to the door of the lodge on most weekends. <sup>[ma77][]</sup>

#### 1979

New locks, bars and road gates all around to deter potential thieves. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1982

Sno-Park ticket price now $7.50 per season. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1983

BNSF Railway discontinued the 78-mile line through the Stampede Tunnel but did not abandon the right of way.

#### 1984

Sno-Park moved to Price Creek. Sons of Norway (Trollhagen) and Meany obtain USFS permit for private parking lot near exit 62 overpass. Meany provided steel gate, Sons of Norway did needed grading. Snow removal by hired bulldozer. Cost for same divided. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1996

BNSF resumed regular train service across Stampede Pass.
