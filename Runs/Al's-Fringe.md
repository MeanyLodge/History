### History

#### 1978

A very important change to the Meany vicinity was made in the summer of 1978 when the Forest Service logged Section 34 which included "Henrietta's Woods" and "No-Name-Woods." These areas are now known as "Henrietta's Meadow" and "Walter's Woods." The gulley between the two has been christened "RBCSA Gulch" and the cross-country ski trail labeled "Al's Fringe."<sup>[ma78][]</sup>
