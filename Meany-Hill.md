# Meany Hill
<img src="/img/1950-Meany-Hill.jpeg" style="width: 40%;" alt="painting of Meany Hill" align="right">
Meany Hill is the big hill located south of the lodge. To find it, walk outside the lodge and look uphill. To ski Meany Hill, head up the trail past the [Pump House](/Building/Pump-House) to the [Coatrack](/Area/Coatrack). From there you can ski downhill to the tows [Super Worm](/Super-Worm), [Mach](Mach), and [Turtle](Turtle).

## Regions

###### Note: Non-cardinal directions in this section are relative to a skier standing at the top of the Lane, near [Top Hut](/Top-Hut), as if they just got off at the top of [Mach](/Mach) and turned to face down the [Lane](/Run/Lane). Aka "skier's left."

### The Western Front

Along the north edge of the Lane, through [Cognito Wood](/Run/Cognito-Wood) towards [Kitchen Run](/Run/Kitchen-Run) lies [Damnation](/Run/Damnation).

Northwest, on skiers immediate left is Upper [Nose](/Run/Nose). Taking it will lead to, surprise, the Lower Nose and then [Psychopath](/Run/Psychopath).

To the west, behind you, as if we removed the safety gate, ran [Mach](/Mach) in 4th gear, and launched you up the ramp into the woods, is [Railroad Meadows](/Run/Railroad-Meadows). If you took the less exciting terrestrial route, you'd be on [Side Track](/Run/Side-Track), which runs from the top of Mach along the top of Railroad Meadows.

South and up the hill from Side Track is [Danny's Woods](/Area/Danny's-Woods). North and downhill of Side Track lies Railroad Meadows. From Side Track you can ski through RR Meadows or take Side Track past the [Couloir](/Area/Couloir) to [Lefty](/Run/Lefty). From Lefty you can catch glimpses of [Stampede Creek](/Area/Stampede-Creek) and pass near the old [Ferguson Pool](/Area/Ferguson-Pool) below [Harvey's Slot](/Run/Harvey's-Slot).

All routes north or west from [Top Hut](/Top-Hut) end at [Psychopath](/Run/Psychopath), which twists along the northwest boundary of Meany Hill. As you ski down Psychopath, pause to reflect upon the achievements of Meany legends. From [Railroad Curve](/Area/Railroad-Curve) you can see [Karen's Corridor](/Area/Karen's-Corridor). The lower section of Psychopath is [Liberation Way](/Run/Liberation-Way), home of [Richard's Ravine](/Area/Richard's-Ravine). Psychopath ends at the switchback of the [Cat Track](/Run/Cat-Track). From there you are uphill of [Hell's Half-acre](/Area/Hell's-Half-acre). The Cat Track leads to the lower Lane. Turning left (north) will descend [Kitchen Run](/Run/Kitchen-Run), pass the [Industrial Park](/Industrial-Park), and arrive at, surprise, the kitchen end of the [Lodge](/Lodge).

### Down the Middle

From anywhere on the [Lane](/Run/Lane), the trees on skier's right are [Soffreenia Wood](/Run/Soffreenia-Wood). Notable attractions within Soffreenia are [Yellow Rock](/Area/Yellow-Rock) and the [Ape Swing](/Area/Ape-Swing). At the bottom edge of the wood lies [Kirkland Park](/Run/Kirkland-Park).

### The Southern Front

From [Top Hut](/Top-Hut), head south. A two-track leads gently uphill. After a short section the two-track turns steeply up to the right and is covered with herringbones, unless you're lucky enough to get first tracks. Another ski trail peels off on the left. Either leads you to [Green Pastures](/Area/Green-Pastures), the grassy area atop [Lower Slobbovia](/Run/Lower-Slobbovia).

Downhill (NE) from Green Pastures is [North Slobbovia](/Run/North-Slobbovia). About 1/3 of the way down is [Iggle's Nest](/Area/Iggle's-Nest) where non-winged creatures sometimes take flight. On skier's right is [Tombstone Canyon](/Area/Tombstone-Canyon), home of Tombstone Creek and our dam water. If there are big holes in the snow near the Dam, especially with brightly colored stuff sticking out, be a sport and help rescue the most recent attempt on the [9 G Pullout](/Area/9-G-Pullout).

Traversing across Green Pastures past Tombstone Canyon and above [Bullmoose Ridge](/Area/Bullmoose-Ridge) leads to [South Slobbovia](/Run/South-Slobbovia). To the east of South lies [Phogbound Gulch](/Area/Phogbound-Gulch) and beyond that lies [Henrietta's Woods](/Run/Henrietta's-Woods). Even further east lies [RBCSA Gulch](/Area/RBCSA-Gulch) and beyond that is [Walter's Woods](/Run/Walter's-Woods).

Skiers descending South are between [Druthers Gulch](/Area/Druthers-Gulch) (left) and [Phogbound Gulch](/Area/Phogbound-Gulch) (right). Near the top is [Big Tree](/Area/Big-Tree). You can't miss [Jacob's Ladder](/Area/Jacob's-Ladder)ðŸ—¼ unless you're a good skier. Just below Jacob's Ladder is [Brockman's Knob](/Area/Brockman's-Knob) and the [9-G Pullout](/Area/9-G-Pullout). As you descend any sane route, watch for the bridge across [Tombstone Canyon](/Area/Tombstone-Canyon). It joins up with [Al's Fringe](/Run/Al's-Fringe) and returns to [Mach](/Mach). Skiers win an award for missing the bridge: uphill travel practice.
