<b>WHEREAS</b>, the Humboldt Ski Club was created in 1937 by Finn Jackson and Reggie Macro at the top of Horse Mountain in Humboldt County at an elevation of 4,600', and

<b>WHEREAS</b>, in 1962 the Horse Mountain Ski Area was adopted by Dr. Jack Walsh, his wife Mary and their children, and a group of ambitious volunteers, including Ralph Kraus and Bill Hilfiker; and

<b>WHEREAS</b>, the Horse Mountain Ski Area grew to 5 rope tows and became one of the most popular recreation activities for hundreds of adults, teenagers, and small children for over 30 years; and

<b>WHEREAS</b>, the hanging weather conditions in the 1980's took away the prolific snow falls from many lower elevation ski areas and ultimately led to the closure of Horse Mountain Ski Area; and

<b>WHEREAS</b>, a group of teenagers that skied Horse Mountain Ski Area in the 1960's and 1970's, known affectionately as the "Grippers," have been meeting semi-annually for 40 years to relive the joys of our youth at our home ski area; and

<b>WHEREAS</b>, an article published by Mountaineer.org outlined the history of the Meany Lodge, its founder Dr. Edmond Meany, and an extensive list of co-founders; and

<b>WHEREAS</b>, many dedicated volunteers and outdoor enthusiasts have been able to preserve and operate the Meany Lodge consistently since the early 1930's.

<b>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT</b> the Horse Mountain Grippers hereby attest our appreciation of the Meany Lodge Volunteers, currently led by Chair Chuck Welter; and

<b>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</b> that from this day forward Meany Lodge shall be revered as a
<b>SISTER LODGE OF THE [HORSE MOUNTAIN GRIPPERS](http://horsemountaingrippers.org).</b>
