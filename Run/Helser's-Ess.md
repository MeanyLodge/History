# Helser's Ess
### Location

From the top of the [Lane](/Run/Lane) to the bottom through the woods.<sup>[n9][]</sup>

### Origin

Named after [Lee Helser](/Person/Lee-Helser). At that time, the trip was made from the top of the [Lane](/Run/Lane) to the bottom through the woods with just the three turns and no checks or side slipping. Lee had a great deal of trouble making this with out landing on his Ass. However, Ass is not appropriate family language so it was shortened to S to reflect the twisted character of the run.<sup>[n9][]</sup>
