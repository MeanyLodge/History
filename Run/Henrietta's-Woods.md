### History

#### 1978

A very important change to the Meany vicinity was made in the summer of 1978 when the Forest Service logged Section 34 which included [Henrietta's Woods](/Run/Henrietta's-Woods) and [No-Name-Woods](No-Name-Woods). These areas are now known as "Henrietta's Meadow" and [Walter's Woods](/Run/Walter's-Woods). The gulley between the two has been christened [RBCSA Gulch](RBCSA-Gulch) and the cross-country ski trail labeled [Al's Fringe](/Run/Al's-Fringe). <sup>[nw][]</sup>

#### 1979

Meany work parties ... started the enormous task of clearing [Walter's Woods](/Run/Walter's-Woods) and [Henrietta's Meadow](/Run/Henrietta's-Meadow). [ma79][]

#### 2020

The trees have all grown back, it has long since been Henrietta's Woods. --[Matt Simerson](/Person/Matt-Simerson)
