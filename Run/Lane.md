# Lane
### Location

The main run down beside the tow (a classic example of Meany understatement.) <sup>[n9][]</sup>

### Origin

This was logged from virgin timber in 1931 and was very much narrower than at present. This gave an appearance somewhat like a narrow road, or "lane" through the woods. <sup>[nw][]</sup>

Very early on the lane was thick with trees. A retired doctor hired loggers to clear the lane but they did a bad job and left big stumps and logs. The Lodge Committee worked really hard for many years getting rid of the stumps, but The Lane was named by the doctor." <sup>[n9][]</sup>

### History

#### 1931

A retired doctor donated funds to contract with two loggers from Easton to fall the trees from the cornice down to the clearing for $100 and so the lane was created. <sup>[ma56][]</sup> The trees were virgin lumber and the lane was much narrower, giving the appearance of a narrow lane through the woods. <sup>[mn][mn]</sup>

The loggers left 3'-4' high stumps and downed trees all criss-crossed. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1932

Unfortunately the loggers were careless, or the trees perverse, for they fell in a jumble, requiring another $100 the following summer to clean up the slash and reduce the fire hazard, which also improved the skiability.

Logs from downed trees laid parallel on fall line of slope. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1935

For the benefit of the lazy and not-too-proud-to-ride, investigations have been made concerning the possibility of installing a rope "ski tow" up the lane. Such a device ... would take much of the effort out of our skiing and rapidly improve our technique because of the opportunity for abundant practice and downhill running. <sup>[ma35][ma35]</sup>

At first the lower lane was used as a practice slope, the remainder being only a convenient means of going to and from the upper slopes of Meany Hill. The more expert used its entire length to some extent but three or four climbs and descents were enough for even the strongest on any one day. <sup>[ma56][]</sup>

#### 1938

Constructed [Mach](Mach) Tow. The head pulley was mounted 70% uphill for a 280' vertical. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1940

The worst pileups of logs were flattened out on the remainder of the "lane" so there will be fewer bumps and a smoother hill this next winter. Finally a ski jump was constructed, the whole lane brushed off and a new and flatter zig-zag trail constructed on the north side of the "lane," for the benefit of all those who do not like to "take 'er straight." <sup>[ma40][]</sup>

#### 1943

300 feet were added to the length of the tow, making it 1,100 feet long with a vertical lift of 300 feet.

#### 1944

Began program to remove all logs from "Lane" and sawed stumps down flush with ground. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1945

- Continued program to remove logs and stumps from Lane. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1949

#### 1957

Safety gate wiring improved. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1962

Lower [Lane](/Run/Lane) bulldozed to improve approach to [Mach](Mach) tow. <sup>[hw][]</sup>

#### 1982

During work party season, Meany women took charge of the "Ox" and the two hill "brush" saws. Thanks to the gals, the whole lane, from top to bottom, had been brushed. This took two year to do but it is now skiable on six inches of snow! The ladies on the "Ox" lifted and hauled firewood, propane tanks, giant pumpkins, dozens of mattresses, Cat ski boxes, tractor treads, brush, garbage, you name it. Meanwhile, Meany men overhauled both tractors (Sno-cats). <sup>[hr][]</sup>

#### 2013

December 31, 2013 was not a good snow day.
