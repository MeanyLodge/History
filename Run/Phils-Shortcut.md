# Phil's Shortcut

### Origin

Named after [Phil Christy](/Person/Phil-Christy)

### History

#### 2022

Nikki's trail followed the road around the hill and back up to the railroad
tracks or it could be extended further east and rejoining the railroad tracks
at a later location.  The shortcut, I believe, was instead of following the
road around the hill was to go straight up the hill on the powerline road to
reach the same spot.  I had never heard of the term "Phil's Shortcut" until
this message.<sup>Phil 2022-05-31</sup>
