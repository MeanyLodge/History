# Railroad Meadows

An area lying west of the headpole of [Mach](Mach), about 600' above the stampede tunnel.

### History

#### 1974

About 1974 the Meany troops completed the partial clearing and grading of an area lying west of the headpole of Mach Tow. This area lies only about 600' from the RR, hence "Railroad Meadows." The 600' distance is nearly straight down through solid rock to where the RR runs in Stampede Tunnel. <sup>[nw][]</sup>
